    WithSecurityContextTestExecutionListener supports generic Annotation
    
    Previously Spring Security's WithSecurityContextTestExecutionListener
    allowed a WithSecurityContextFactory<Annotation> to be used. This
    was broken in SEC-3074.
    
    This commit ensures that WithSecurityContextFactory<Annotation> is
    supported again.
    
    Fixes gh-3837

    SEC-2332: GlobalMethodSecurityConfiguration includes proper voters
    
    Previously GlobalMethodSecurityConfiguration did not include the correct
    voters. This updates the code and the tests to ensure that the proper
    voters are added. Note this got past testing previously due to all the
    voters abstaining, so tests were added for ensuring that methods could also
    be invoked sucessfully using the configured annotation.

    SEC-2136: Lazy load MethodSecurityExpressionHandler & MethodSecurityExpressionHandler.expressionParser
    
    Previously wiring dependencies created with a FactoryBean into
    MethodSecurityExpressionHandler &
    MethodSecurityExpressionHandler.expressionParser and  would cause
    NoSuchBeanDefinitionException's to occur. These changes make it easier
    (but not impossible) to avoid such errors.
    
    The following changes were made:
    
        - ExpressionBasedAnnotationAttributeFactory delays the invocation of
          MethodSecurityExpressionHandler.getExpressionParser()
        - MethodSecurityExpressionHandler is automatically wrapped in a
          LazyInitTargetSource and marked as lazyInit=true

    SEC-1885: Change SecurityDebugBeanFactoryPostProcessor to only interact with BeanDefinitions rather than instances to prevent premature instatiation of FilterChainProxy and its dependencies
    
    This issue occurred because the AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor had not been registered when the SecurityDebugBeanFactoryPostProcessor tried to obtain the FilterChainProxy. This caused
    all of the FilterChainProxy's dependant beans to be resolved and if they used @Autowired they would not get processed properly.

    Added Java 5 Annotations version of Contacts sample (contacts-tiger).
    
    Note: I have added a pre goal to add the source dir of  the original Contacts example.
    
    I also added an exclude on the main project.properties for the attributes sample, as the Commons Attributes plugin causes issues with Java 5 source compilation.
    
    The Annotations version will eventually replace the Commons Attributes approach, for now those users will need to manually build the attributes example.
