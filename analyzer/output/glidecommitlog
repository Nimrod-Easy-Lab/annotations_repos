    Add tests for Glide’s annotation processor.
    
    Fixes GlideOptions.OVERRIDE_REPLACE and GlideOptions.OVERRIDE_NONE options (previously they would cause complication errors if used).
    
    Fixes an NPE caused by skipStaticMethod.

    Cleanup Glide’s fat jar.
    
    1. Eliminates the separate debug/release variant builds since both are identical at the moment.
    2. Depends on compilation tasks rather than build tasks to reduce build time
    3. Removes annotation/compiler from the fat jar javadocs (it wasn’t included in the javadocs anyway)
    4. Remove deprecated usage of javaCompile.

    Build improvements (#2426)
    
    * Update Gradle version to latest
    
    * Fix typo in dependency name (Gradle was resolving support-annotations:{26})
    
    * Bump Android Gradle Plugin version to latest stable
    
    * Remove deprecation warning during compile.
    (@SuppressWarnings("deprecation") has no effect on imports)
    
    * Force LF as the line separator to make sure checkstyle is runnable on Windows
    
    * Constrain deprecation of GlideModule to a single method (suppresses javac warning)
    
    * Make sure compiledJar's output is unique.
    archivePath was the same as jar's archivePath, which triggered a rebuild and re-proguard every time, even on incremental builds.
    
    * Move quality tool initializations near the tasks
    Extract version constant for PMD
    
    * Minor gradle improvements: warnings, Java compatiblity
    
    * Extract test JVM memory size to gradle.properties
    
    * Enable auto-completion in IDEA by using tasks.create instead of task shorthand
    
    * Reduce amount of hard-coded paths
    
    * Reduce amount of missing files when running findbugs
    
    * Add missing test for setMemoryCategory return value
    
    * Simplify JavaDoc classpath calculation
    
    * Change JavaDoc {@link}s to {@code} as they're not linkable.
    This reduces the noise during build.
    
    * Fix invalid missing references in JavaDoc.
    The equals/hashCode method doesn't exist in the classes, so need to reference the super-class.
    
    * Fix checkstyle, javadoc alignment, typo and codify class-name-like concepts.

    Use Dagger 2.11 in imgur sample (#2425)
    
    * Remove unneeded excludes from imgur sample
    jsr305 is repackaged, so there won't be a conflict on annotationProcessor classpath
    
    * Increment Dagger version to 2.11
    There are breaking API changes (renames) and use the new API to reduce custom code.
    
    * Further simplify injection by using the Dagger library components

    Avoid varargs warnings using @SafeVarags in generated code.
    
    The annotation can only be added to final methods, so we have to use
    @SuppessWarnings for RequestOptions instead. As a result callers of
    transforms() will have to suppress the warning on their end as well.
    
    Fixes #2383.

     * Fix Gradle deprecation warning during build
     * Make samples' build.gradle files more similar
     * Remove redundant <uses-sdk> from manifest

     * Add @TargetApi annotations to test code to suppress LINTs
     * Reduce the scope of suppressions or remove them completely
     * Use some specialized mocking/matching methods to reduce uncheckedness
    
    GIF related classes:

     * Add some documentation from the standard for the constants
     * Remove some meaningless comments
     * Convert most inline comments to JavaDocs
     * Add annotations for ints designating color/status/etc (int is too overloaded)

    Glide nullable annotations. Part 1; the major bits and pieces.
    
    I may have misinterpreted some of these. Particularly unsure about ModelLoader#buildLoadData(). Is the model allowed to be null? I've noticed many implementations dereference it without checking but I've also noticed one instance of null (possibly) being passed in (StringLoader.java). I've left it without the nullable annotation as StringLoader seems to be the outlier here.
