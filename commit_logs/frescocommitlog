    Issue #1969 Fix LocalVideoThumbnailProducer#getLocalFilePath for videos from Android document provider.
    
    Summary:
    This resolves #1969.
    `LocalVideoThumbnailProducer#getLocalFilePath` will return null for uris like `content://com.android.providers.media.documents/document/video%3A160`. Inspired by https://github.com/iPaulPro/aFileChooser/blob/master/aFileChooser/src/com/ipaulpro/afilechooser/utils/FileUtils.java, this PR just fix this case.
    
    Since this method is private and the test uri in `LocalVideoThumbnailProducerTest` is just a mocked uri starts with `file://`, there is no test to cover.

    Support inverted rotation orientations
    
    Summary:
    When an inverted EXIF orientation is detected, it executes a different new JpegTranscoder method that accepts the actual raw EXIF value rather than rotation angle in degrees. Rotation angle is set to 0 for inverted orientations.
    
    This only rotates inverted orientations in the pipeline and does not yet support it for deferred rotations. Normal orientations can still be deferred.

    In preparation of supporting the inverted orientations (2, 4, 5, 7), we need to store the orientation value and not just the rotation angle in EncodedImage.
    
    The reason I've used 0 for unknown exif orientation is that JfiUtil already treats 0 as unknown exif to be consistent with the rest of the codebase

    fix BetterImageSpan size calculation
    
    Summary: BetterImageSpan getSize is supposed to increase the top or bottom of the font metrics to fit the image but it doesn't increase the bottom. If the image is taller than the font size then it will be cut off from the bottom. This fixes the size calculation to also increase the font bottom metric.

    ImmutableMap and ImmutableList: initialize with known capacity
    
    Summary:
    The final capacity of these `HashMap` and `HashSet` is known at creation time. By providing the capacity parameter we avoid resizing them (and potentially save some memory).
    
    The default `HashMap#MINIMUM_CAPACITY = 4` and the `HashSet` is backed by a `HashMap`

    Added error handling for ExifInterface StackOverflowError
    
    Summary: In some rare devices creation of an ExifInterface object using large images results in a StackOverFlowError. This catches the error and logs it but then just allows getExifInterface() to return null since it looks like we can't do anything else (similar to how IOException is handled).

    Issue 1850: Restart warning message for showcase SVG support toggle
    
    Summary:
    A restart message/warning does not appear when SVG support (svg decoder switch) is changed. A restart is necessary because custom decoders can only be set during Fresco initialization.
    
    Run showcase app. Check that message comes up when SVG support is turned on/off.

    Fresco issue 1827: Fix loading of SVG files that do not start with "<svg"
    
    Summary:
    Solves the problem of certain SVG files not loading when the SVG file does not begin with "<svg".
    
    **Manual Test 1: Check loading of example SVG.**
    1. Set `ImageFormatSvgFragment.URI_SVG_HALF_TRANSPARENT` equal to `Uri.parse("http://frescolib.org/static/sample-images/fresco_logo_half_transparent.svg");`
    2. Run showcase app
    3. Ensure that SVG support is turned on
    4. (If SVG support was 'off' at the beginning of step 3) Re-run showcase app (<-- This is necessary because the SVG toggle switch does not currently trigger a re-rendering of the image. A follow-up bug has been reported on this.)
    
    **Manual Test 2: Check loading of SVG that starts with "<?xml".**
    1. Set `ImageFormatSvgFragment.URI_SVG_HALF_TRANSPARENT` equal to `Uri.parse("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/SVG_logo.svg");`
    2. Run showcase app
    3. Ensure that SVG support is turned on
    4. (If SVG support was 'off' at the beginning of step 3) Re-run showcase app
    
    **Tests added to test.java files**
    
    None.
    
    Note: ImageFormatChecker.determineImageFormat() should probably have a test, though... I'd be happy to write that as part of another pull-request (or add it to this one).
    
    1. (**ImageFormatCheckerUtils.java**) New util that determines whether or not an InputStream contains a given header.
    2. (**SvgDecoderExample.java**) When image header starts with "<?xml", search headerBytes for "<svg".

    Added legacy Drawee visibility handling for Android N and above to fix activity transitions
    
    Summary:
    In Android N, visibility handling of ImageView was changed to use `onVisibilityAggregated`, which doesn't update the visibility of the starting drawee view correctly when the activity transition is reversed.
    As a workaround, you can now just enable legacy visibility handling for the affected `DraweeView`s.

    Add PlatformBitmapFactory to showcase app (contains rainbows)
    
    Summary:
    This adds an example on how to manually create Bitmaps using Fresco's `PlatformBitmapFactory`. It also demonstrates how one could handle the `CloseableReference<...>` correctly within an object with a lifecycle.
    
    When starting and backgrounding the showcase app, you should be able to see something like the following in logcat:
    
    ```
    // onStart(): allocating the bitmaps (256 * 256 * 4 = 2.6 MiB)
    com.facebook.fresco.samples.showcase V/unknown:BitmapPool: Used = (123, 81076240); Free = (0, 0)
    com.facebook.fresco.samples.showcase V/unknown:BitmapPool: get (alloc) (object, size) = (67234be, 262144)
    com.facebook.fresco.samples.showcase V/unknown:BitmapPool: Used = (124, 81338384); Free = (0, 0)
    com.facebook.fresco.samples.showcase V/unknown:BitmapPool: get (alloc) (object, size) = (3a6891f, 262144)
    
    // onStop(): releasing the bitmaps

    Fix CircleCI: Explicit NDK unzip target location
    
    Summary:
    CircleCI was broken by the last changes to update the NDK. As a result Circle-CI failed on all current builds.
    
    The underlying reason is that the pre-configuration commands are executed in the `/home/ubuntu/fresco` folder, but were supposed to run in `/home/ubuntu`. Subsequently, the NDK ended up in a wrong location.
    
    Adding the explicit destination folder to the `unzip` command using the `-d destination_folder` option.
    
    Circle CI passes after this change: https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/fresco/1012 (or see below).

    Fix IncreasingQualityDataSource to keep low res image if hi res fails
    
    Summary:
    Turns out that if the high res image fails to load (e.g. instant 404), while the low res is still loading, the low res is cancelled. This diff makes it so that IncreasingQualityDataSource stores the failure cause for the high res while waiting for all other requests to complete.

    Add ImageUriProvider
    
    Summary:
    The `ImageUriProvider` makes the sample image URIs transparent to the samples.
    
    The URI can be chosen based on:
    
     - Size
     - Orientation
     - Whether to append a cache-breaking parameter
    
    Further, it allows for two global settings:
    
     - Override each URI with a custom one
     - Add cache breaking parameter by default

    Moved DrawableFactory to imagepipeline-base
    
    Summary:
    NOTE: This is a breaking change for custom drawable factories (e.g. if you add Keyframes / SVG support).
    In order to fix the build, change the `DrawableFactory` import from `import com.facebook.drawee.backends.pipeline.DrawableFactory;` to `import com.facebook.imagepipeline.drawable.DrawableFactory;`.
    
    `DrawableFactory` is closely related to the imagepipeline since it takes a `CloseableImage` (which lives in `imagepipeline-base`) and creates the Drawable that renders the image.
    By moving it to `imagepipeline-base`, we have everything required to add support for new image formats in the same module and it's also possible to use `DrawableFactories` standalone without the need to depend on Drawee.

    Move AnimatedImageFactory to animated-base
    
    Summary:
    `AnimatedImageFactory` is no longer used within Fresco, only in `AnimatedFactoryImpl`, so we can move it to `animated-base` which will only include it if needed.
    This also means that it can be easily removed later on.

    Add Showcase sample for partial loading
    
    Summary:
    Adds a sample to the Showcase app in which we can load part of an image and then follow that with a request for the remainder of the image.
    
    The first "load partial" button loads just the first 30000 bytes of the image and the second launches a request to load the remainder of the image.
    
    Currently, the first image is cached against the URI so the rest of the image isn't loaded. This enables the testing of the implementation as it's fleshed out in following diffs.

    Bitmap.prepareToDraw: Add BitmapPrepareProducer
    
    Summary:
    This change adds a `BitmapPrepareProducer` that optimistically uploads a `CloseableStaticBitmap` to the GPU. Requests that are pre-fetching are ignored and just passed through.
    
    By calling `Bitmap#prepareToDraw` the `RenderThread` can upload the `Bitmap` asynchronously when it's idle. This has often moves the upload out of `DrawFrame` and therefore improves the critical path.
    
    This came up from issue https://github.com/facebook/fresco/issues/1756 that was risen from the Android UI Toolkit Graphics team.
    
    I've verified the change using `systrace` on my Google Pixel phone. Screenshots in the comments

    #1664: Prevent ConcurrentModificationException in Volley
    
    Summary:
    Issue:
    https://github.com/facebook/fresco/issues/1664
    
    It's because that _Volley_ notifies `listeners` inside a `for-loop` uses `mBatchedResponses.values()` :
    ```
    for (BatchedImageRequest bir : mBatchedResponses.values()) {
      ...
      mListener.onResponse(...)
    }
    ```
    After some methods calling inside the `onResponse`, finally, the `mBatchedResponses.remove` will be called.
    
    The stacktrace will look like:
    ```
    inoke mBatchedResponses.remove(mCacheKey)

    Stop reading encoded cache key from EncodedImage
    
    Summary:
    Caching using keys held by `EncodedImage` was a work-around to avoid caching alternative from media variations using the originally-requested URL.
    
    Now that we can stop the image being cached at all in that case, we can go back to using the original cache key.
    
    I've also deprecated the setting and retrieving of the cache key in `EncodedImage` but haven't removed it as it may be used by consumers of Fresco.

    Catch exception when opening an ExifInterface for a non-jpeg
    
    Summary:
    Fixes #1558 and #1760.
    
    When a local file is loaded an attempt is made to load the thumbnail from its exif data but that is only available for JPEGs.
    
    Trying the same with a PNG lead to an `IOException` which wasn't being caught within the producer. Catching it allows us to return null which is the appropriate thing to do if no thumbnail is available.

    Create new version of onNewResult with Status flags
    
    Summary:
    In order to allow more information to be passed, a new version of `onNewResult()` is added which receives an int called `status`.
    
    For now, this lives alongside the existing `onNewResult(T, boolean)` until all consumers have been edited to implement the new one. This also means `BaseConsumer` temporarily contains implementations of both methods. When complete the old one will be removed and the new one will become abstract.

    Fixed animated gif frame transpacency for multiple graphics control blocks
    
    Summary:
    According to the GIF standard there should only be one GCM block per frame, but in practice there seem to be some GIFs that have multiple.
    This fixes incorrect transparency calculations for GIFs with multiple graphics control blocks for a frame.
    The current version always took the first GCM block whereas all other implementations I've tested (e.g. Chrome) seem to use the last GCM block instead.

    Optimize BitmapDrawable, add comments
    
    Summary:
    Thanks for submitting a PR! Please read these instructions carefully:
    
    - [x] Explain the **motivation** for making this change.
    - [x] Provide a **test plan** demonstrating that the code is solid.
    - [x] Match the **code formatting** of the rest of the codebase.
    - [x] Target the `master` branch
    
    Here are the takeaways from a recent experiment at fb related to drawing circular bitmaps:
    
    It's probably possible to optimize the rounding drawables used by Fresco:
    1. Let's not apply a matrix if we don't need to
    2. Consider avoiding a path when using addRoundRect alone would work
    
    This PR does those 2 optimizations. For 2., we skip paths altogether and call `Canvas.drawCircle`, but only on Android versions where it's faster. From the research:
    
    "On Android 11-16, drawRoundRect is actually slow because those api versions used alpha mask textures to draw shapes.. Consequently, the support library falls back to doing 7 draw commands on those api versions (drawing arcs and rects)."
    
    (Also add some comments - it took me a while to understand the purpose of each class, hopefully this will save some time for people touching the code in the future.)
    
    Ran the Showcase app, the Rounded Corners example looks the same as before, also when changing scale types:

    Better FrescoFrameCache bitmap reference conversion
    
    Summary:
    The current approach for converting a `CloseableReference<CloseableImage>` to a `CloseableReference<Bitmap>` has a flaw:
    We constantly do conversions in both directions to read / write from the cache. This means we create new ResourceReleasers for one direction and  wrap the same `CloseableReference<Bitmap>` in new `CloseableStaticBitmap` objects.
    This means, that we always increase the call stack and keep references to all previous `CloseableStaticBitmap`. This will eventually result in stack overflow exceptions and it wastes memory.
    
    The alternative solution here is to use a clone of the underlying Bitmap reference instead in order to be able to immediately close old `CloseableStaticBitmap`s and to get rid of custom `ResourceReleaser`s.

    Return valid bitmap references for FrescoFrameCache
    
    Summary:
    We cannot use `CloseableStaticBitmap.convertToBitmapReference()` to create the `CloseableReference<Bitmap>` from a `CloseableReference<CloseableImage>`.
    It works fine if prefetching is disabled (if we do not hold on to the references), but if prefetching is enabled and we hold on to the bitmaps until they are first drawn (see stacked diff), this does NOT work correctly.
    The reason for this is the implementations of `CountingMemoryCache` and `CountingLruMap` make use of `CloseableImage.getSizeInBytes()` to update their respective sizes in bytes.
    `CloseableStaticBitmap.convertToBitmapReference()` will detach the underlying bitmap from the `CloseableStaticBitmap`, which is used to calculate the size in bytes. Hence, the size will be reported as 0 when the elements are changed and the cache cannot correctly decrease its size. This means that the cache thinks its size is constantly increasing until it will eventually stop caching new items - which will break all other images as well.
    
    The solution to this problem is to not detach the bitmap reference from the bitmap. Instead, I am just returning a new `CloseableReference` with the underlying bitmap with a custom `ResourceReleaser` that will close the `CloseableImage` when appropriate, which will result in correct computations.

    This is necessary since we don't want to immediately recycle these frames until they have at least been drawn once.

    Decrease draw calls and dropped frames for AnimatedDrawable2
    
    Summary:
    This fixes an issue with frame scheduling if the next frame is scheduled slightly too early.
    Frames were scheduled exactly at the start of their visibility window, which results in dropped frames in case the frame is drawn slightly too early.
    If the drawable is redrawn too early, we will start rendering the previous frame. Rendering could be too slow and cross over the visibility window for the current frame - which would result in skipping the frame entirely.
    
    There are two values that can be specified to delay the next draw command and to offset the animation time.
    - The scheduling delay delays the next draw command for the next frame.
    - The offset adjusts the animation time by a given offset.
    
    Different combinations for both values for a sample animation with 10 frames, 48 ms frame times, 50 loops:
    
    delay 0 ms, offset 0 ms:
    `draw: frame:  9, drawn: true, delay:   4 ms, rendering:   2 ms, prev:  50 ms ago, duplicates: 175, skipped:  38, draw calls:  637, anim time:  23956 ms, next start:  24000 ms, next scheduled:  24000 ms`
    
    delay 0 ms, offset 8 ms:
    `draw: frame:  9, drawn: true, delay:  21 ms, rendering:   0 ms, prev:  17 ms ago, duplicates: 131, skipped:   0, draw calls:  631, anim time:  23973 ms, next start:  24000 ms, next scheduled:  24000 ms`
    
    delay 4 ms, offset 4 ms:
    `draw: frame:  9, drawn: true, delay:   7 ms, rendering:   1 ms, prev:  50 ms ago, duplicates:  17, skipped:   0, draw calls:  517, anim time:  23959 ms, next start:  24000 ms, next scheduled:  24004 ms`
    
    delay 8 ms, offset 0 ms:
    `draw: frame:  9, drawn: true, delay:   3 ms, rendering:   1 ms, prev:  34 ms ago, duplicates:   1, skipped:   0, draw calls:  501, anim time:  23955 ms, next start:  24000 ms, next scheduled:  24008 ms`
    
    Since 8/0 yielded the best results for the devices I've tested this with, I'm setting the default values to 8/0.

    Add ProducerListener.onUltimateProducerReached()
    
    Summary: Adds a new callback to ProducerListener which is called by a producer if, and only if, it's responsible for the ultimate satisfaction of the request. That's to say, if the image is found in the encoded memory cache, `EncodedMemoryCacheProducer` will call this listener method. Likewise for other cache producers, `NetworkFetchProducer` and extensions of `LocalFetchProducer`.

    Revert: Build jpegturbo as a shared library
    
    Summary: This reverts pull-request #1686 (https://github.com/facebook/fresco/pull/1686). After it has been landed it was discovered that it would increase the APK size for apps that just use the *core* library. We are committed to keep the core small and therefore we decided to revert it to the previous state.

    fix stream res leak
    
    Summary:
    **Test plan**
    Please clone the demo from https://github.com/caojianfeng/FrescoDemo.git
    And run it.
    Now it will crash when started or scroll the image list.
    And My test device is Android 4.1.2 .I receive this:

    Change media variations index to return instance of MediaVariations
    
    Summary:
    In order to hold extra data about results from queries to the index, this diff changes the return type to be an instance of `MediaVariations` instead of `List<Variant>`.
    
    This enables following diffs which will include pulling a media ID which isn't explicitly included in the image request, as well as another which will add to the map included in producer listener callbacks from this producer.
    
    `MediaVariations.getVariants()` is also removed and replaced by two methods: `getVariantsCount()` and `getVariant(int)` to remove any chance of the list being modified.

    Build jpegturbo as a shared library.
    
    Summary:
    Link jpegturbo as a shared library for reduce apk size.
    
    See [#1865](https://github.com/facebook/fresco/issues/1685)
    
    After this work, if somebody use webp support, his so library would be (file size is measured in armeabi-v7a abi):
    
    - **libfb_jpegturbo.so** 165kb
    - **libimagepipeline.so** 26kb
    - **libstatic-webp.so** 290kb
    
    Totally: 481kb
    
    Before (which would link jpegturbo as a static library):
    
    - **libimagepipeline.so** 230kb
    - **libstatic-webp.so** 362kb
    
    Totally: 592kb (So we reduce 117kb just in armeabi-v7 !)
    
    But if someone only use imagepipeline (not use webp support), he would also have 39kb size reduce!

    Don't rely on cache's memory index for media variations
    
    Summary:
    The original implementation of the MediaVariationsFallbackProducer only ran an in-memory index check for each variant.
    
    In cases where the index is incomplete (as is common with DiskStorageCache) this results in false misses.
    
    With this change, a full disk read is attempted for each variant until one is found. The list is sorted so that the most appropriate variant is tried first.
    
    The media variations sample had masked this shortcoming due to its row of variants being loaded before the main image.

    Summary:
    Only one class in imagepipeline-test has a dependency on imagepipeline-base.
    
    This moves the other classes so that the dependency chain for tests can run as follows:
    
    ```
    fbcore
      /\
    imagepipeline-base-test
      /\
    imagepipeline-base
      /\
    imagepipeline-test
      /\
    imagepipeline
    ```
    
    This will enable adding unit tests to `DiskStorageCacheTest` which use `TextExecutorService`.

    Move PooledByteBuffer to fbcore to remove circular dependencies
    
    Summary:
    PooledByteBuffer being in imagepipeline-base resulted in circular dependencies between imagepipeline-base and imagepipeline-base-test.
    
    Due to this we had disabled `EncodedImageTest` in the Gradle file.
    
    This moves the whole `com.facebook.imagepipeline.memory` package in imagepipeline-base to the `com.facebook.common.memory` package in fbcore.
    
    Those tests are also enabled once more.

    fix duplicate media variant entries
    
    Summary:
    **motivation** :
    when I download some images with media variations feature enabled, then I got some entries written to the media variations index database, but if I cleared all the previous cached  images (or load the same image while writing index info to the db) , and reload those images again, I would got duplicate entries with the same mediaId, width, height and resourceId pointing to the same disk cache key
    
    **reproduce steps** :
    0. check out current master branch
    1.  just run example/media-variations
    2. click to load all the images
    3. then click the "Clear cache and reset" menu
    4. reload all those images again
    5. repeat step 3 and 4 if you want
    6. pull the media-variations index database from the test device, open it using a sqlite3 client and query all entries from media_variations_index table
    7. ***observable result*** : you would find more than one entries with identical mediaId, width, height, resourceId, cache_key and resource_id (except the auto generated primary key)

    Added custom image decoder override to ImageDecodeOptions
    
    Summary:
    This makes it possible to use a custom decoder for selected images only.
    
    Usage:
    
    ```
        ImageDecodeOptions imageDecodeOptionsWithCustomDecoder = new ImageDecodeOptionsBuilder()
            .setCustomImageDecoder(CUSTOM_COLOR_DECODER)
            .build();

    Summary: Since the `close()` method doesn't call through super, `mIsClosed` is never set to true, so `isValid()` will always return true for `CloseableReferenceWithoutFinalizer`. Override `isValid()` so this works correctly.

    Avoid making multiple copies of the same list
    
    Summary:
    The existing implementation of ImmutableList.of(...) is inefficient. It makes a temporary copy of the list, then copies the contents over again into the final list. This unnecessarily uses both allocations (expensive on Android) and CPU time.
    This diff makes a single copy of the data, as would be expected by an immutable list implementation aiming to manage its own data.

    Synchronize on same object when reading or writing media variations database
    
    Summary:
    Ensure that write and reads to the index database synchronize on the same object. Previously, reads were in a synchronized method but there was no protection around writes.
    
    Also, this removes the unnecessary `close()` call which existed after reading from the database (no close call was present in the writing case).

    Explicitly uses `BufferType.SPANNABLE` to let `SimpleDraweeSpanTextView` know that it might need to resize itself. See associated issue: https://github.com/facebook/fresco/issues/1633
    
    Feel free to suggest alternative solutions; I think this is safe to do and a cursory search didn't turn up anything better, but I suspect maintainers of `DraweeSpan` might know more about spans than I do!

    Showcase sample app: add sample about post processors
    
    Summary:
    This diff adds an extensive example regarding post-processors. I hope the implementations serve as a guide for best-practices of doing such kind of image-processing.
    
    The loaded image is deliberately huge in order to increase the visibility of the speed.

    always use animated decoder for gifs
    
    Summary:
    Turns out the naive implementation in GifFormatChecker does not cover all cases. For example, this gif doesn't have the graphic control extension header for frames: {F65219848}. This makes us decode it as a static bitmap, showing only the first frame. After long and arduous conversations with oprisnik, we've reached the conclusion that the best thing to do is to simply always use the animated decoder (which correctly decodes the frames, in spite of the missing header).
    
    This has the drawback of making all GIFs skip memory cache. However, oprisnik's new animation framework should fix that.
    
    This has been raised here: https://github.com/facebook/fresco/issues/1524

    Added BitmapAnimationBackend for animations v2
    
    Summary:
    The `BitmapAnimationBackend` glues all parts together.
    The following logic is applied when a new frame should be drawn:
    
    * Check if the frame is cached by the `BitmapFrameCache` and just draw it if this is the case.
    * Check if the `BitmapFrameCache` has an existing free bitmap that can be used to render the current frame. If we have one, render the new frame using `BitmapFrameRenderer` and draw it.
    * Create a new bitmap using the `PlatformBitmapFactory`, render the frame using `BitmapFrameRenderer` and draw it.
    * Check if the `BitmapFrameCache` has a fallback frame (e.g. the last drawn frame) and draw it.
    * Don't draw anything.

    Allow request to force download of primary Uri even if alternative found
    
    Summary:
    A flag has been added to MediaVariations which requests that the original image should be requested even if an alternative image was found which otherwise appears good enough to not require the network request.
    
    This is needed (and used here) for the sample app which otherwise would not download the individual variants once one has been saved.

    Mitigate crash in ForwardControllerListener caused by race condition
    
    Summary:
    In #1504 a race condition is described that leads to a `OutOfBounds` in `ForwardingControllerListener`. It happens when a `ControllerListener` is removed while an event is propagated in the `for` loop of any of those methods.
    
    This diffs mitigates the crash by moving the `get(i)` part inside `try-catch` block. By this we still have visibility when it happens, but it does not crash the app.

    This ensures that if the media variations fallback produces a non-final image the request is still forwarded to the next producer if disk cache is set to the lowest level to use.

    Make media variations sample image resizable to test with different resize options
    
    Summary:
    This adds a new ResizableFrameLayout to the sample app so that the user can resize the image ahead of re-requesting the image.
    
    The benefit here is that the user can then test what happens when they request the image with a request containing different resize options.

    Summary:
    Subclasses overriding the `fetch` method might want to reuse some of its functionality. This change splits the `fetch` method into 2 methods to make this reusability possible: `fetch` and `fetchWithRequest`.
    
    This Fresco change will be consumed by React Native PR facebook/react-native#7791 which enables React Native apps to specify headers to include in the HTTP request when fetching a remote image. For example, one might leverage this when fetching an image from an endpoint that requires authentication.

    Create SplitCachesByImageSizeDiskCachePolicy
    
    Summary:
    This creates the second of the standard disk cache policies we commonly use, to place images below a specified threshold into the small cache and larger images in the default cache.
    
    The policy isn't used yet, that will follow in the next diff.

    Create DiskCachePolicy
    
    Summary:
    DiskCachePolicy is a new interface intended to extract the interaction with the default and small caches from the producers and into new collaborators.
    
    This will enable the reuse of DiskCacheReadProducer for media variations fallbacks.
    
    For now I've created the simplest implementation to read and write from whichever cache the image request specifies.

    Summary:
    This creates a new producer by taking only the parts of DiskCacheProducer which writes to the disk cache.
    
    This will provide the benefit of being able to place a fallback step in between write and read which may be able to read an alternative file from cache without having to force it into the existing producer.

    Fast Native Blur: Implementation of the algorithm
    
    Summary:
    This change introduces a native blurring algorithm based on an iterative box blur. While it is also very fast, it's main advantage is it very small memory consumption that allows it to work (almost) in-place.
    
    This implementation's runtime is **O(iterations * width * height)**. It's memory boundary is **O(radius + max(width, height))** with small factors and constants.
    
    A naïve box blur would create the output image by applying a uniform kernel. Example for 3x3 blur filter kernel (r=1):
    
    ```
             1 1 1
    1/9 *  [ 1 1 1 ]
             1 1 1
    ```
    
    This implementation does use some tricks to prevent the bad runtime behaviors that come with the naïve approach:
    
     - The box blur is split up into a horizontal and vertical blur (see "Wojciech Jarosz. 2001" for background)
     - Splitting up into a horizontal and vertical blur then allows to just have a temporary copy for the current row or column
     - We use a pre-computed division table `div` that is increasing the speed significantly as divisions are expensive operations
    
    An iterative box blur does quickly approximate a Gaussian blur. The difference after 3 iterations is very close to the exact result of a Gaussian filter (convolution).

    Updated demo app grid layout to Material Design specs
    
    Summary:
    The demo app didn't have any image padding, which made it hard to see where individual grid items end.
    I've updated the specs to have a 4dp grid list padding between items according to [1].
    However, I made the overlay top and bottom padding just 8dp instead of 16dp so that you see more of the actual image.
    I have also added a white background so that you see the actual bounds vs the image bounds.

    Update compile target, build tools and support to 24.x and clean up
    
    Summary:
    After this change, the Fresco library builds with the newest SDK target and uses the latest support libraries. I've taken the opportunity to remove unneeded references to the support library.
    
    As the support library got split up in 24.2.0 (see https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/revisions.html#24-2-0-v4-refactor), I've used the smaller targets where appropriate. I did not update references in tests.
    
    Tested that everything builds:
    
    ```
    ./gradlew clean build test
    ```
    
    Verified sample apps run correctly:
     - animations
     - scrollperf

    RotateOptions also incude an option to defer rotation until the bitmap is rendered, as drawee supports this.

    Checked in code style settings for Fresco project
    
    Summary:
    This checks in the file that controls the code style when using IntelliJ or Android Studio.
    
    This is desirable due to the Facebook style being a little non-standard (at least in terms of indentation) which results in unecessary effort to fix the formatting of PRs, either by the original author or by the importer.

    Extract common extra map constants and make producer names public
    
    Summary: As some tooling and logging can rely on producer names in the `RequestListener`, we should make the producer names public. This makes it easier for the client application to be kept in-sync with changes of the producers or fail early during compiling.

    Allow for fetching local encoded images
    
    Summary: Before this diff, one could only fetch encoded images from the network (i.e. http/https). However, there are use-cases where fetching through the pipeline is convenient. Examples are: it's already in the encoded cache and saves us a disk access or we want to leverage the Fresco webp to jpeg transcoding. Furthermore, this makes the imagepipeline a bit more transparent to use.

    Update image format of encoded image if not already known
    
    Summary: We already call `parseMetadata()` on the `EncodedImage` in various producers (which tries to set the image format) so in theory the image format should never be null in the first place. However, if we have an error and we manage to determine the image type later in the decoding step, we might as well update the encoded images so that subsequent decoding steps are faster.

    Added warning message if Fresco is initialized more than once
    
    Summary:
    Fresco should only be initialized once, so we should have a warning if somebody re-initializes Fresco since this causes everything to be recreated and can result in memory leaks.
    We use finalizers to avoid most of these leaks but it's still something that should be avoided - especially if you're doing it unintentionally.
    
    In the future, we plan to crash here for debug builds.

    Use initial capaticy constructor when it's appropriate
    
    Summary:
    When you create a <code>ArrayList</code> or <code>HashSet</code>, you have to use constructor with
    initial capacity argument if you know its final size beforehand.
    Because we can avoid enlarging its backing array. This becomes critical
    when the size of list becomes larger. For example, the <code>mBitmaps</code>
    field in <code>CloseableAnimatedBitmap</code> class can hold many bitmaps, because
    it holds bitmaps of animation.
    
    Many classes in this project already follow such usage. I found
    some classes that do not follow it, and changed those.

    Add ControllerViewportVisibilityListener for hints about the drawee entering/exiting the viewport
    
    Summary: For various logging it is useful to know whether an image has been loaded while it was on screen. As Android has no definite way to get information about views entering and exiting the screen, it is the best when the client provides this information as hints. This change adds an optional `ControllerViewportVisibilityListener` to receive events from a new callback method `DraweeController#onViewportVisibilityHint`

    Parse GIF Netscape 2.0 extension for loop count
    
    Summary:
    The current usage of `giflib` does not parse application extensions. In order to play the correct number of iterations of GIF animations, one has to parse the `Netscape 2.0 Looping Extension`. This is not part of the specification, but de-facto standard in all major clients.
    
    Luckily, `giflib` already provides us with the blocks s.t. we only need to parse them. See http://www.vurdalakov.net/misc/gif/netscape-looping-application-extension and the following quote for information on how the block is structured.

    Reverted build tools version to fix CircleCI
    
    Summary:
    We've switched CircleCI to use Ubuntu 14.04 but this causes Android NDK problems since it is not installed per default (see https://discuss.circleci.com/t/android-ndk-installation-and-configuration-on-circleci/3816).
    We're reverting back to Ubuntu 12.04, which only has Android Build Tools 23.0.2 - so we have to revert to a supported version.

    Don't strip AnimatedFactoryImpl and AnimatedFactoryImplSupport constructors
    
    Summary:
    `AnimatedFactoryImpl` and `AnimatedFactoryImplSupport` currently have the `DoNotStrip` annotation.
    However, ProGuard strips their constructors since they are not used directly (we use reflection to instantiate them).
    By manually addin `DoNotStrip` to these constructors, we make sure that they are not stripped.

    Pass caller context when creating disk cache keys
    
    Summary:
    This passes the caller context when creating the disk and encoded cache keys, just as they already are for bitmap cache keys.
    
    The default implementation ignores this but there is now also a `DebuggingCacheKey` which holds the value for later reference.

    Properly handle requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent
    
    Summary:
    If the current gesture performed on our ZoomableDraweeView haven't caused the transform to be corrected, we request our parent to not intercept events as we are going to hndle them. If on the other hand the transform got corrected, it means we tried to scroll past the bounds and we will let our parent intercept the events in case it wants to.
    
    As a consequence we can zoom-in, pan the image around, and once we reach the edge, the parent will take over and perform paging, as the user would expect. With this fix I hope we solved issues with ZoomableDraweeView within another scrollable containers such as ViewPager, etc.

    Always reserve space for a background and an overlay
    
    Summary:
    This achieves two things:
    * It allows us to dynamically change backgrounds and overlays
    * It saves memory as we removed 5 instance integers and added only 2 instance null-references (two null elements in the array of the fade drawable)
    
    An additional change is that multiple backgrounds are from now on deprecated. Context:
    This improvement required a small interface change between GenericDraweeHierarchy and its builder. In particular, GenericDraweeHierarchy now has only one layer dedicated for a background. Multiple backgrounds are still supported via builder, but this gets emulated by wrapping them with an ArrayDrawable. In theory this should work fine, with one caveat. Rounding no longer works for multiple backgrounds. This would be relatively easy to support, but given that multiple backgrounds are rarely used feature (if ever), instead of introducing additional complexity we decided to deprecate it instead.
    In case where there is only one or no background, everything should work as it was before.

    Summary:
    Since I changed the Fresco demo to build against the remote modules it's become clear that is not intuitive. It's also created a problem for anyone who wants to demonstrate a now feature in the demo.
    
    This change makes the internal build flavor active again while leaving the remote build flavors commented out so they are still available for testing new releases but don't get in the way of development between releases.
    
    This will fix our current CI build failure.

    Drawee scaletype transition
    
    Summary:
    As mentioned in #22 ChangeImageTransform for DraweeViews is not working correctly, when ScaleType is changing during transition. This pull request resolve this issue by added custom DraweeTransition, which animates ScaleType transition correctly
    
    InterpolatingScaleType is changed by adding start and end values of parentBounds. In pervious version it used parameter parentBounds, which changing every animation frame and it caused wrong animation behaviour.
    
    Transition sample is changed due to use DraweeTransition. Also background was added in sample image, to show how animation works

    Upgrade to OkHttp3
    
    Summary:
    Update to [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) to [OkHttp3](https://publicobject.com/2015/12/12/com-squareup-okhttp3/)
    
    We must also update:
    - Fresco to 0.10.0
    - okio to 1.8.0
    
    **Motivation**
    Reasons for upgrading:
    * Issue #4021
    * "We discovered that RN Android sometimes fails to connect to the latest stable version of NGINX when HTTP/2 is enabled. We aren't seeing errors with other HTTP clients so we think it's specific to RN and OkHttp. Square has fixed several HTTP/2 bugs over the past eight months." - ide
    * OkHttp3 will be maintained & improved, but OkHttp2 will only receive [security fixes](https://publicobject.com/2016/02/11/okhttp-certificate-pinning-vulnerability/)
    * Cleaner APIs - "Get and Set prefixes are avoided"
    * Deprecated/Removed - HttpURLConnection & Apache HTTP
    * React Native apps are currently being forced to bundle two versions of OkHttp (v2 & v3), if another library uses v3
    * Improved WebSocket performance - [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master

    Add ImagePipelineExperiments
    
    Summary:
    This creates an area within the ImagePipelineConfig where we can clearly place new config options while we experiment with them.
    
    The intention is for these configuration options to be volatile, liable to change and sensible to avoid for open source users unless they have a strong desire otherwise.
    
    This will allow us to move faster on such experimentation without the same worry of whether we're breaking public APIs.

    Changed ArrayList to ArrayDeque so that the runnables are FIFO-ed
    
    Summary:
    So this is based on the discussion in #512
    
    Consider a list of network fetched images:
     - When the user pauses,you want the image that he is current viewing to be loaded first.
     - Currently since the methods are synchronized,it would not make sense implementing Thread Safety.
     - However if you plan to make this multi-threaded ,I can work on the thread safe implementation here(I would be implementing a multi thread environment for my purpose).
     - I realize the change is pretty negligible :) ,sorry about that.

    Added support for synchronous disk cache check
    
    Summary:
    Added a support to check in disk cache synchronously. The call will block the caller thread.
    This is useful when you want to manually check if an image is present in disk cache inside a async callback, this prevents nesting of callbacks.

    Summary: This is the first step in the process of nineoldandroid removal. This module differs from the animated-base just because it uses nineoldandroid classes. In the next diff I'm going to remove the dependency of the animated-base from the nineoldandroid classes. In the third diff I'll implement a way to use the support classes if present in the classpath. If not the classes from the animated-base will be used.

    Added circle.yml for CircleCI
    
    Summary:In order for the build to pass on CircleCI, we need to add the Android NDK to the path - so I added a simple `circle.yml` file.
    Also, CircleCI does not support v23.0.0 for the Android build tools, so I updated them to v23.0.1.

    Minor refactor in multi-pointer gesture detector
    
    Summary:* Chnge internal state to `started` only after the listener is notified. This makes the contract more consistent and avoids some problems along the road.
    * Start gesture immediately on tap-down, instead of on first move. This was originally done in move event in case we'd like to start gesture only after pointer moves over some threshold, but this is still possible (if ever needed) and it is cleaner this way.
    * Keep information about `newCount` so that `onGestureStop` listener can know both the number of taps before and after. This information is useful for zoomable controller.
    * Other than that, some code is extracted to methods.

    Created AnimatedImageFactory abstraction - The BIG one
    
    Summary:In this diff we want to abstract the AnimatedImageFactory from its optional implementation. This is the main diff of the series and basically creates interfaces into a module which could be implemented by implementation in the optional modules. In the specific:
    
    imagepipeline-base
    -----------------------
    Contains all the interfaces for abstractions
    AnimatedDrawableFactory
    AnimatedFactory (new interface to abstract all the animated*** classes)
    AnimatedImageFactory
    
    AnimatedFactory is the interface which will be implemented into the animated-base module if some animations are present. The animated-gif and animated-webp have animated-base as dependency so adding one of them will add animated-base as well.
    AnimatedFactoryProvider is the class responsible to check for the presence of AnimatedFactory implementation.
    
    animation-base
    -----------------------
    This modules contains the implementation for the AnimatedFactory which basically is responsible to check if implementation of the AnimatedImageDecoder interface are present for Gif and Webp. The AnimatedImageDecoder is the interface which abstract the decoding of animated image for Gif and Webp.
    The
    
    animated-webp
    ------------------
    This contains the implementation of the AnimatedImageDecoder interface for Webp Images. This is an optional module the presence is checked into the animated-base module
    
    animated-gif
    ------------------
    This contains the implementation of the AnimatedImageDecoder interface for Gif Images. This is an optional module the presence is checked into the animated-base module
    
    Unfortunately It's difficult to split this into other diffs.
    This builds also on gradle
    
    UPDATE: Talking to tyronen, we agreed we can reduce dependencies with animation abstracting more the AnimatedDrawable objects. I will be doing this into a new diff [11bis/12].

    Add support for custom scale types
    
    Summary:This diff adds support for providing custom scaletypes to Drawee. The implementation for the preexisting scale types is preserved.
    This is a non-breaking change, however the old static method has been deprecated. It is advised that direct usages of `ScalingUtils.getTransform(..., scaleType)` be converted to `scaleType.getTransform(...)`.
