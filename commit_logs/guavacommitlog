    Fix inheriting docs from the JDK.
    
    This broke somewhere between 18.0 and 19.0, I'd wildly speculate because of changes to Maven?
    http://google.github.io/guava/releases/18.0/api/docs/com/google/common/hash/BloomFilter.html#hashCode%28%29
    http://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/com/google/common/hash/BloomFilter.html#hashCode%28%29
    
    So it took 2-3 years to notice :\
    
    I chose this new phase based on:
    "Invokes the execution of the lifecycle phase generate-sources prior to executing itself."
    https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/javadoc-mojo.html
    
    And generate-sources seems to make more sense than anything that comes before that:

    Import Map.Entry almost everywhere.
    
    Qualified types make @Nullable annotations more complicated: If we're using a type annotation, the "@Nullable" has to come between "Map." and "Entry" rather than before the whole thing. That means diffs between the mainline, presuming that it supports type annotations, and the backport, presuming that it doesn't. It's not entirely clear that that's how things will work out, but I can't experiment until I fix the problem, and I figure I might as well submit the fix, given that I think we generally like doing this, at least with Multiset.Entry isn't in play? But it's not very hard to handle the problem as it comes up, either, if this CL is too much.
    
    (Naturally, the same problem will exist for other types. But this CL fixes the most common problem.)

    Try out @OverridingMethodsMustInvokeSuper, and remove some unnecessary work in AbstractMapTester.
    
    The first couple locations I found to use @OverridingMethodsMustInvokeSuper were cases where we're already doing the right thing, so that's "disappointing."
    
    On the plus side, while I was looking into this, I noticed that AbstractMapTester is redoing all the work of its superclass (at least assuming that no one tries to override resetMap() rather that resetContainer() -- if anyone should be overriding that at all...). So I fixed that. Maybe, if we're lucky, it will make our GWT and Android tests faster -- at least internally, where we actually run our suite-builder suites on those platforms. But the GWT test times are variable enough that it's hard to be sure without a bunch of runs, and the Android tests aren't running at the moment (b/30863522), so... I don't know if this really helps or not.

    Don't construct thousands of strings.
    
    Test timings aren't 100% consistent, even when I run the Maven tests locally (rather than the internal tests in some random cluster), so don't take this as definite truth, but I'm seeing some apparent improvements from this CL, even after my earlier CL to decrease the iteration count.

    Reduce iterations for MinMaxPriorityQueueTest under GWT.
    
    I had a bunch of theories as to why these tests were slow (string construction, java.util.Random, collection construction). They are probably part of the story -- especially string construction, which I might still submit a CL to reduce -- but fundamentally, I think the slow thing is our many calls to isIntact(). Let's not make so many. Likely the non-GWT tests would catch any problems here, anyway, and we'll still run the tests under GWT, albeit with fewer iterations, in case we have an obvious bug there.
    
    This is a clear win internally: All MinMaxPriorityQueueTest methods are now under 10 seconds, and I'd previously seen ~6 over that mark, including 1 around a minute and 2 around 30 seconds. I'll get some external numbers next.

    Make all "Tester" classes *end* with "Tester," and simplify our exclusions accordingly.
    
    (We might be able to fully switch to glob-based .java includes/excludes now, rather than regex-based .class includes/excludes, but .class makes more sense, since Maven is really looking for classes, not source files, and I don't really feel like running the tests yet more times to make sure that I didn't accidentally exclude something new.)

commit 3cc6ea4f51413794f6e24e693676dbf57b307520
Author: cpovirk <cpovirk@google.com>

    Run nested classes for real this time.
    
    I had thought that CL 157867713 accomplished this, but it didn't. My CL description there says that I tried both an <exclude> approach and a %regex approach, and only %regex worked. But I just reran tests before and after that CL (with both Maven 3.5.0 and Maven 3.1.1), and the CL makes no difference in the number of tests run, and in particular it doesn't run nested tests.
    
    My theory is:
    - I inserted a fail() call into a *specific* test and looked for the failure, rather than looking at the total number of tests. That still isn't a complete explanation, of course, because that failure should have happened in both cases or in neither. So probably also...
    - I had both <exclude> and a *different* %regex value present at one point, and *that* was enough to run this particular nested test.
    - Then I removed <exclude>, I assume because I got confused about what I was testing.
    - I also removed the fail() call.
    - Finally, I changed the %regex value to avoid running AbstractPackageSanityTests and other classes that don't end in "Test." If I had still been running nested classes at this point, still had the fail() call present, and still been looking for the failure, I would have found that it was no longer running.
    
    (Update: Alternative simpler theory: The test I inserted the fail() call in was a FooTest class nested inside a BarTests class whose suite() method adds FooTest. This test would not have run originally (because "BarTests" doesn't match "**/*Test.java" and the FooTest class is nested and thus excluded). But it would have run during my initial testing of the new CL because I originally included *Tests as well as *Test. But then I removed the *Tests part because I didn't see any top-level classes of that name other than the problematic PackageSanityTests classes. At that point, I didn't retest the original failure. Unfortunately, my .bash_history cuts off right around the time of the original CL (but that's another story... :)).)
    
    As best I can tell:
    
    - The old "**/*Test.java" *does* run some nested test classes *if* I add <excludes>. Even though Maven purports to accept the name of a .java file, it appears to be internally turning it into a class name, so it can match nested classes that don't have a top-level source file of their own.
    - But it doesn't run *all* nested tests, since some of their names don't fit the "FooTest" pattern. Specifically, it runs the same set of tests as the existing %regex filter.
    
    So it seems that we don't need %regex at all. But there's a catch: Maven now tries to run various nested classes that aren't supposed to be run as tests. And the easiest way to get the correct set of classes is to use regex after all.
    
    I haven't spent a ton of time trying to find the absolute most correct set of tests, but the filters in this CL should be pretty close. The filters include everything, whether a top-level class or nested class, with a new documented exclusions.

    Run tests in a deterministic order.
    
    We just had a failure that depends on test execution order. It wasn't too hard to figure out (and would have been even easier with the output that I'm adding in CL 174361258), but determinism is a good thing that may help us in the future.
    
    (It *might* also bring us closer to the Bazel test-runner behavior, but I haven't actually checked. And anyway, we shard some of our Bazel tests, so even if both systems now use the samer order, they might be executing different subsets of tests, so they still might not show the same errors.)

    Print the actual output of failed tests.
    
    Luckily, last time I was able to guess at the cause specifically because it was an "error" and not a "failure."
    And typically we'd be able to reproduce the failure by running locally, though I'm not sure if that's the case here because it depends on test ordering... which is currently dependent on the filesytem's order of files, but I'll deal with that in a separate CL.

    Fix links to JSR305, and start linking to JDK 9.
    
    The main problem with the JSR305 links is that the JDK -link argument was "claiming" the javax.annotations package. This was happening for 2 reasons:
    - <detectJavaApiLink> defaults to true, so Maven adds its own -link (or -linkoffline, not sure) for the JDK. So I unset it.
    - We manually specified a -link argument, and Maven's command-line order puts -link before -linkoffline (which, oh, we're now using -- see below). So I made the JDK a -linkoffline argument, too, which is still possible when we're pulling the package-list from online.
    
    There's an additional problem, which is that Javadoc (or Maven? I forget) tries to download http://static.javadoc.io/com.google.code.findbugs/jsr305/3.0.1/, which gives an access denied error, even though it needs only the package-list file in that directory, which downloads fine. As a fix, make our own local copy of that package-info file. I've also done that for j2objc-annotations, though currently none of its annotations are @Documented, so it's not doing us much good yet.
    
    Then, in the process of switching to a manual -link for the JDK, I lost JDK links. It turns out that Javadoc doesn't like the http links to the Oracle site, even though it's fine with http links from other sites. I switched to https (and did the same for the other projects while I was there), and I posted this on https://stackoverflow.com/q/29867384/28465#comment80906399_29867384 to hopefully help anyone else in this situation. (I'll also try to ask our Java platform team about fixing the javadoc man page.)
    
    Conveniently, the switch to a manual -link also lets us choose which version of the JDK to link to. It seems like Java 9 makes the most sense...? It's true that we promise compatibility with Java 8, but I think the normal thing would be to link to the newest version. I see in particular that we linked to Java 7 from the backport. That's defensible, but it's a bit weird: The primary target for the backport is Android, and we target a "Java-6-like" version of the Android SDK. The only "Java-7-like" thing we do is use language features like the diamond operator. The Java 7 link does make sense for actual Java 7 users, but I still think we're likely better off linking to JDK 9 Javadoc and letting users look at @since when they want. This should also help in cases in which we want to link to a newer type along the lines of "If you can use java.util.function.Function, do so."
    
    (Oh, and while I was there, I added a comment to explain why we *also* need JDK sources, as I'd forgotten.)

    Update hasPublicSuffix javadoc
    
    "google" is a public suffix, and "google.foo" is under public suffix "foo". Therefore hasPublicSuffix() should have returned true for both of them. In fact both TLDs (.google and .foo) are owned by Google Registry, i. e. us!
    
    I tested calling InternetDomainName.from("google").hasPublicSuffix(), which returns true as expected. Same goes for "google.foo".
    
    I suspect this javadoc has not been updated after the last round of gTLD expansion. This method really should only return false for domains that are under nonexistent TLDs, like "google.invalid", or fake TLDs themselves, like "invalid" (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.invalid).

    This is the only thing I haven't been able to suppress by using -q or a flag to suppress output for specific plugins.

    Handle InheritableThreadLocals correctly on Java 9.
    
    The internal Finalizer class is used by FinalizableReferenceQueue. In order to avoid holding a reference to the ClassLoader that loaded the class, it is necessary to avoid inheriting any ThreadLocals in the thread running the Finalizer code. Previously, we did this with a nasty hack accessing a private field in Thread. Although that field still exists in Java 9, private accesses like these are not allowed by default. This particularly access is also not needed on Java 9, since there is now a Thread constructor with a boolean parameter that says whether to inherit ThreadLocals. So we use that constructor if it is present, in preference to the field access.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2723.

    Update the farmHashFingerprint64() javadoc to specify how FarmHash's numeric fingerprint is encoded by HashCode#asBytes().
    
    The HashFunction interface demands that an implementation output bytes [1]. But FarmHash's Fingerprint64() is defined (by its C++ reference implementation) as returning a 64 bit unsigned number and farmHashFingerprint64() doesn't specify how this number is encoded by HashCode#asBytes(). This change will assure users that HashCode#asLong() from Guava's implementation of FarmHash will yield the same value as would be returned by farmhash::Fingerprint64() on the same input. The current "byte-wise identical to C++" language isn't helpful because again, C++ FarmHash returns a uint64_t not bytes and the C++ language doesn't specify how this value is encoded in memory.
    
    No code changes are needed because the unit tests already compare the output of #asLong() with golden values.
    
    [1] The HashCode abstraction is nice but #asLong() and #asInt() are both are defined in terms of #asBytes()

    For clarity, re-apply @Beta to the CharMatcher constants.
    
    We deprecated the CharMatcher constants back when they were @Beta. Then we removed @Beta from the class. Because these methods were never present as non-@Deprecated, non-@Beta APIs, and because they are expensive to initialize on Android, we'll still remove them.
    
    Since we're removing them, it makes sense to put our "We might remove this" annotation them. Doing so should make things clearer to humans, and it should allow tools to identify usages of these APIs to warn about possible breakages.

    Fix documentation for checkArgument and checkState
    
    Both claim
    
    @throws NullPointerException if the check fails and either {@code
    errorMessageTemplate} or {@code errorMessageArgs} is null (don't let this
    happen)
    
    but this doesn't actually happen - the message is created using
    Precondition.format that handles null values without throwing.
    
    This is more of a concern for the "don't let Args be null" because having
    potential null args is in fact a legitimate usecase.

    Set version numbers to 24.0-jre-SNAPSHOT.
    
    This makes Maven consider 24.0-jre to be "newer" than 24.0-android.
    That's preferable, as discussed in https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2914, https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2839, and https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NYGbfz56C0Oh4IGymXjeQUVK4FcRiqDbpc4vGLnDMrY/edit#
    
    RELNOTES: To upgrade to Guava 24.0, change your version numbers to "24.0-jre." (Or, if are writing an Android app or Android-compatible library, use "24.0-android.")

    [guava concurrent] Renamed SerializingExecutor to SequentialExecutor. Turned SerializingExecutor into a proxy to SequentialExecutor so two Components classes that directly use it have a chance to catch up.
    
    Components CL to change Components usages should be independent.
    
    RELNOTES: Renamed Guava's SerializingExecutor to SequentialExecutor to match the new MoreExecutors.sequentialExecutor() method.

    ImmediateFuture.toString() implementation to provide the returned value or exception.
    Provides for all ImmediateFutures implementation the same syntax that AbstractFuture uses.
    
    It's especially convenient during debugging of mocked asynchronous gRPC services.
    
    Fixes bug in AbstractFuture#toString in GWT that caused wrong representation:
    "Class$S413@205[status=SUCCESS, result=[FAILURE, cause=[Class$S6]]" due to ongoing
    builder being already called when getDone() throws exception.

    Store the CancellationException.class (as we do in other tests), not the cause of the CancellationException.
    
    The cause is null nowadays, so we were presumably never taking the if() branch at line 467.
    That meant that we weren't actually checking isCancelled().
    A comment also suggests that we could theoretically have seen test failures because it was possible for setFuture to also succeed, but I don't think we've seen that in practice. I have spent 0 seconds thinking about whether there's anything deeper to ponder here.
    
    (I noticed this while migrating to multicatch. This CL also adopts multicatch in one place where it does make sense.)

    Suppress tests broken by CL 164180554's emulator upgrade to API level 15.
    
    It seems like that particular version of Android might not GC as aggressively (perhaps specifically for variables in the current method that have been nulled out, perhaps specifically when GC isn't strictly required -- I don't know).
    The tests pass under the newest emulator, though, so I don't think there's a bug for us to report. Hopefully it's just a quirk of GC and not some strange way that some versions of Android are actually retaining a reference (not that we could necessarily do anything about it, anyway).

    Fix an interruption bug from CL 162649353, but do so in a way that doesn't reintroduce yet another bug that that CL fixed.
    
    Specifically, go back to setting the runner thread before checking isDone() (so that we can't end up with a task that was cancel(true)ed but runs without being interrupted).
    
    But also, if aborting because isDone(), spin until we've received the interrupt, just as we do during normal completion (so that we don't end up interrupting the thread after the task is done).

    Fix a bug in AbstractFuture.setFuture
    
    If the future being assigned was cancelled then there could be slightly different behavior based on whether or not the wasInterrupted bit is set and whether or not it was a TrustedFuture.  The fix is to never propagate the wasInterrupted bit from setFuture.
    
    This also fixes the potentially confusing behavior where wasInterrupted could be true but interruptTask() would never be called.
    
    For all these reasons, it remains the case that setFuture can never cause interruptTask to be invoked.

    Fix interruption leak in submitAsync and whenAllComplete().callAsync().
    
    There are two bugs in the handling of TrustedListenableFutureTask:
    
    1. Returning an future that was cancelled with interruption calls setFuture(), which then calls interruptTask() on the output future - this then calls InterruptibleTask.interruptTask(), which happily interrupts the thread that directExecutor.execute() was called on.
    
    2. The thread that InterruptibleTask runs on is referenced forever, and CombinedFuture nulls out its reference to InterruptibleTask in afterDone() - which is called after interruptTask. This means that if the setFuture() path is taken, then cancel(true) is called, the thread that called the callable will be interrupted, even after InterruptTask.run() has returned.
    
    If we've ever seen spurious InterruptedExceptions in production, this could be a cause - whenAllComplete().callAsync(callable, executor).cancel(true) can interrupt whatever thread callable was called on, even long after call() returns. If that thread is part of a pool (which it probably always would be), then this would interrupt whatever unlucky task happened to be running on that pool thread later.
    
    This CL adds earlier nulling out of the InterruptibleTask in TrustedListenableFutureTask, as well as makes InterruptibleTask robust to having interruptTask called after runInterruptibly has returned. To avoid tasks interrupting themselves when they call setFuture of an interrupted and cancelled future, a new method allows subclasses to end the interruption window early - this should also somewhat reduce the race of directExecutor() listeners being interrupted.
    
    Additionally, by splitting CombinedFuture.setValue() into 2 methods, this CL fixes the equivalent of https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2254 for Futures.whenAllSucceed/whenAllComplete.

    Rollforward [] which was rolled back in [] because it
    caused some tests using appengine to fail with IOExceptions when calling
    FileInputStream.available().  The workaround in the rollforward is to not call
    the method.  The one case where we were calling it we had actually already
    called a similar method, so trying again doesn't seem valuable anyway.
    
    *** Original change description ***
    
    Implement ByteSource.asCharSource(charset).read() using the decoding string
    constructor instead of streaming the contents into a StringBuilder.
    
    this allows us to avoid a number of copies that are currently happening for
    each character (1. into a temporary CharBuffer, 2. into a StringBuilder, 3 into
    the String char[]) and replace it with simply whatever is required by
    ByteSource.read() and the String(byte[], charset) constructor.  For certain
    ByteSource implementations (like FileByteSource) ByteSource.read() can often
    presize the byte[] correctly and the string constructor can also do some things
    to guess at the correct array sizes and avoid copies in the common case.
    
    Benchmarks have shown that this should improve the speed of Files.toString
    significantly.

    Shutdown the original executor in getExitingScheduledExecutorService.
    
    The shutdown hook thread names itself after the executor, presumably to aid in debugging.  If the original executor does NOT shutdown quickly, looking at the thread dump shows an executor never created by application code.

    Optimize CharStreams.copy to take advantage of known Readable/Appendable types.
    
    The most common Readable is a Reader which has good support for reading char arrays, the most common Appendable is either a StringBuilder or a Writer, both of which have good support for writing char arrays.  Furthermore the default implementation of Reader.read(CharBuffer)  is less than ideal (copies the characters an extra time) and the default implementation of StringBuilder.append(CharBuffer) calls charAt() on every character (instead of trying to access the underlying array()) which incurs lots of bounds checks.  Similarly Writer.append(CharBufffer) calls toString() on the CharBuffer which incurs an extra copy.  So depending on the combination of types involved we may copy the bytes 4 times instead of 2.
    
    By adding specialized implementations we can avoid this overhead most of the time and deal with simple char arrays for our temporary buffers.

    Make documentation on iteration order more explicit.
    
    ImmutableCollection specified that each construction pathway would specify how it does ordering, but we didn't really follow through on that.  Now, we
    
    - add more explicit documentation to the main construction pathways for the main immutable collections
    - specify in ImmutableCollection that it's usually insertion order

    ValueGraph.edgeValue*: change from
    * V edgeValue(), V edgeValueOrDefault()
    to
    * Optional<V> edgeValue(), V edgeValueOrNull()
    
    Fixed Graphs.inducedSubgraph() implementations so that it appropriately specifies the # of nodes in the induced subgraph as being the size of the supplied node Iterable.
    
    Fixed MoreGraphs.inducedSubgraph() implementations so that the filtered nodes are being returned as Lists rather than Iterators, so that calculating their size doesn't exhaust the Iterator.
    
    Fixed the graph *Builder from() methods so that they are all uniformly enforcing types (this was causing MOE problems in conjunction with the expectedNodes() call.

    Prepare common.graph for GWT/j2cl usage.
    
    1. Had to replace String.format() uses, because it's not supported for j2cl.
    2. Had to mark Network-related code as @GwtIncompatible because of uses of
       java.lang.ref.SoftReference, which j2cl cannot support.
    
    Needed as a step toward using common.graph in JSCompiler.

    Use a newer version of Mockito, as necessary for Java 9.
    
    Apparently 2.8.40 is out, but currently we're internally upgrading to 2.7.19, so that seems like the safest thing to target. (But I'm sure we'll get to 2.8.40 or later eventually, so maybe I'm wasting time bothering with 2.7.19....)

    Resurrect SingletonImmutableList on server side only.
    
    Bazel has apparently measured that in their applications, ~50% of ImmutableLists have size 1.  This is significant enough that it's probably worth resurrecting the optimization to have a specialized implementation that just wraps the one element.

    Disable some tests externally until GWT releases a version with the problematic bug fixed.
    
    The tests work fine in non-GWT mode, but we don't have a trivial way to say "run this everywhere except externally under GWT," so I'm just stripping them entirely.
    (In particular, I don't think "// MOE:insert @GwtIncompatible" works because we would stil generate a StreamsTest_gwt that refers to the removed methods, so it would fail to compile.)
    This ensures that we still run them internally in both modes, which seems more important than running them internally+externally but never under GWT (as @GwtIncompatible would do).

    Run nested classes in the open-source build.
    
    Evidently Maven looks only at top-level classes by default -- perhaps by scanning for .java files and then looking for the corresponding top-level classes?
    http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#includes
    
    I'd found a suggestion here that I might just need to override the default excludes:
    https://confluence.atlassian.com/clover/using-clover-with-maven-+-surefire-test-+-inner-test-classes-285840787.html
    But I couldn't find a way to get that to work -- which makes sense in light of the .java point above. I'm guessing that the linked page is not actually trying to explain exactly how Maven skips nested classes, only that it does so at all.
    
    The syntax is documented here:
    http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/inclusion-exclusion.html#Regular_Expression_Support
    
    The regex here should match everything that the old default did, and it now pulls in nested classes, too, since it operates on .class files, as documented in the previous link. For the old default, see:
    http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#includes
    (The old default also includes Test* and *TestCase, but those don't appear to match any new test classes for us, so I didn't bother complicating the regex for them.)
    
    Correction: *Our* old value was "**/*Test.java," since we set that manually.
    That dates back to CL 41635188.
    I'm not sure why I thought that was the default at the time, but evidently the Maven docs of the day were just plain wrong, claiming that the defaults include only "IT" classes:
    https://web.archive.org/web/20130102062549/http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#includes
    Anyway, we were already omitting *Tests.java.
    I initially planned to include *Tests.java, but then I discovered that this includes PackageSanityTests classes.
    I *thought* I had seen all tests run successfully anyway, but now I'm seeing failures[*], so I've gone back to omitting PackageSanityTests classes.
    (And "*Tests.java" doesn't match any tests other than PackageSanityTests classes.)
    
    Continuing to omit PackageSanityTests is reasonable enough, at least in the short term:
    
    - (minor) We sometimes want to run it in a different VM. That said, that problem is solvable in other ways, and we already elected to be lazy and skip it entirely: https://github.com/google/guava/commit/cc2b970f45d28a9258dbd9c01fda97a4ba293c20 (Of course it turns out that we were skipping it entirely already. And in fact, that commit didn't intentionally remove PackageSanityTests; it just changed our build macros to reflect in the open-source build something that was already happening internally -- that PackageSanityTests wasn't part of our main test target (though it is run in a separate test target). The commit's actual purpose was to avoid publishing some unrelated files.)
    
    - We probably don't really want to run against benchmark classes. At best, doing so seems wasteful. And worse, it's causing failures. Likely AbstractPackageSanityTests should be configured to skip benchmarks, just as it today skips tests. But I'd rather save that for yet another CL.
    
    The bottom line here might be that this is another reason to move from Maven to Bazel (at least assuming that Bazel's test runner is equivalent to our internal one). cc=ronshapiro :)

commit b4fc54a63768fc5a85935e38fe2694b0563aba81
Author: cpovirk <cpovirk@google.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 2 12:24:15 2017 -0700

    In 4 files, manually include a TestCase in its own suite().
    This lets the open-source build run those tests.
    
    Details: Our internal test runner, given a TestCase with a suite() method, always runs the TestCase in addition to the suite(), even if the suite() doesn't include it.
    The external Maven test runner, by contrast, skips the TestCase itself unless the suite() includes it.
    That's led us to add the suite manually: https://github.com/google/guava/blob/fac8339c87815fb7deca0cf01d61a5146355723f/guava-tests/test/com/google/common/collect/SetsTest.java#L116
    But we missed it in a few recent cases.
    
    I noticed one of these cases when I ran the open-source GWT tests and they failed (because we're using an old Truth version externally, which I'm also fixing).
    This raised the question of why the non-GWT tests weren't failing in the same way, and the answer is that this suite() business was skipping them.
    I identified other affected tests with:
    
    $ grep -rl '^  public static Test suite[(][)]' */test/ > /tmp/files
    $ grep '^  public void test' -l $(for F in `cat /tmp/files`; do BASE=$(basename $F .java); grep "addTestSuite($BASE.class)" -L $F; done)
    
    Note that, with this solution, we run the tests *twice* internally.
    This is unfortunate but probably livable.
    An alternative that we've employed is to move the tests into a nested class, which we then don't need to add to the suite:
    https://github.com/google/guava/blob/fac8339c87815fb7deca0cf01d61a5146355723f/guava-tests/test/com/google/common/collect/ImmutableListTest.java#L127
    That way, we run the test only once internally.
    The downside is that we don't run it externally at all :(
    I should fix the external problem for the existing tests, but that's a problem for another CL (CL 157852006, pending).
    
    Another alternative is to move all our suites out of the main test files.
    This is possibly a good idea, anyway, as it's a prerequisite for running the suites under GWT and Android, which would have caught problems like []But again, one thing at a time...

    This CL also migrates the last usage of it to Stats — it so happens that the last usage is in a subpackage of math, so I think it's okay to do it at the same time (especially as it's a safe local change that only affects unit tests).
    
    It also removes a couple of references in the javadoc for the Quantiles benchmark algorithms class (which probably shouldn't have been in the open source version anyway, oops). They don't really add value now.

    Fixed the targets that were really broken deep down, but we also reverted the slight semantics change that exposed the issues.  I think the changed semantics were fine, but I don't think it's important enough to make a fuss.

    Walking concat(concat(c1, c2), concat(c3, c4)) changed from requiring 41 allocations to requiring 22.

    Remove some misleading interruption docs:
    - Our interruption behavior doesn't fully match the JDK. My point in CL 23833126 was that both AbstractFuture and the JDK implementations throw if the thread was interrupted *before* the get() call as well as during. But:
      - We differ from the JDK in a different area: We throw InterruptedException even if the get() call wouldn't have had to wait. (We see this as a feature: Since the task is apparently cancelled anyway, we might as well take this opportunity to abort.)
      - My phrasing may be equally misleading in the other direction: It may suggest that get() throws if the thread was *ever* interrupted in the past. More generally, by changing the phrasing at all, I may be suggesting a change in behavior where none exists.
    - InterruptedException support is probably in some sense "optional," but there's no reason to call it out as specifically optional for AbstractFuture.

    Rewrite ImmutableSortedMultiset.Builder on Android to avoid using TreeMultiset, which allocates a ton of objects and also uses a ton of code.
    
    The strategy we use is a little modified from how we changed ImmutableSortedMap: on every expansion, we sort and deduplicate the elements that have been added to the builder.
    
    (modest reduction in bytes allocated, significant reduction in objects allocated, significant constant factor increase)

    Provide specializations of MapMakerInternalMap's internal data structures, notably InternalEntry, for the case where the value type is a singleton. This is Interners's exact use case.
    
    This CL is a pure refactor that results in a strict memory win. No public apis are changed.
    
    I am very happy that my design made this refactor very easy :)
    
    There are the following Interners use cases:
    - Interners#newStrongInterner
    - Interners#newWeakInterner
    and the following relevant jvm flags:
    - -XX:+UseCompressedOops
    - -XX:-UseCompressedOops
    
    Of the four combinations of interner type and pointer size, the most important use case is probably Interners#newWeakInterner, since users tend to put lots of stuff in weak interners. On a 64-bit jvm with +UseCompressedOops, there's actually no win because of the way the current object alignment for WeakKeyStrongValueEntry works out. However, the current object alignment works out unfavorably on a jvm with -UseCompressedOops, and so this CL gives a sizeable win there.
    
    The CL also gives very large savings for Interners#newStrongInterner, but I reckon that use case isn't too important.
    
    Summary of results:
    -------------------
    StrongInternerImpl w/ +UseCompressedOops --> 19.8% savings
    WeakInternerImpl w/ +UseCompressedOops --> 0.00016% savings
    StrongInternerImpl w/ -UseCompressedOops --> 12.3% savings
    WeakInternerImpl w/ -UseCompressedOops --> 9.0%% savings

    Make some generics explicit that the maven-compiler-plugin can't figure our when compiling for Java 7
    
    Each change was reflected in the mainline, or has already deviated from the mainline, so this shouldn't incur any additional forking costs.

    For APIs that require Java 7, strip them from Guava-Android entirely, not just from our internal copy of Guava-Android.
    This prevents a third-party library from using them, only to fail when used with our internal Guava-Android.
    
    To accomplish that, we use @GoogleInternal instead of @AndroidIncompatible, but we use it only on the Java 7 branch.

    minor enhancements to serializingexecutor
    
    * only acquire/release the lock once per call to execute (inline the top half
      of startQueueWorker into callers). the bytecode of startQueueWorker is long
      enough that it probably doesn't get inlined and thus things like hotspot lock
      coarsening probably aren't trigerring.
    * only allocate the queue worker once, and repurpose it for the lock
    
    This leads to a small bit of redundancy in execute/executeFirst/suspend, however, due to the needed control flow in the caller, i am not sure if it is very avoidable.  Also, it does allow us to avoid some redundant checks (e.g. no need to check queue size if we just added an item)

    Harmonize NPE @throws clauses on FluentIterable.toXX() methods and friends
    
    I noticed that toSet() and toList() each lacked an @throws NullPointerException for the case where an element of the FluentIterable is null; this seems like an omission given that their sorted cousins have the @throws, as do the various other toXX() methods that return an ImmutableXX as well as index() and uniqueIndex() which are similar in spirit.
    
    I also standardized toMap(), index(), and uniqueIndex() to each use the same format for listing the reasons they can throw NPE (null element, or null function result).  Note that these can also throw NPE on a null parameter to the method, but that is not documented per convention since the package has @ParametersAreNonnullByDefault.
    
    Finally, I updated Multimaps.index() and Ordering.immutableSortedCopy() to adopt this convention as well (since they're passed through to by the FluentIterable methods), and I tidied up some wording choices (e.g. consistently using "{@code null}", and using "element of this iterable" instead of just "element" when the method takes parameters).

    Eliminate references to ImmutableAsList in ImmutableMultiset.
    
    ImmutableMultiset, for once, doesn't have a specialized asList(), so this does the right thing on both server side and Android: on Java 7, it returns a normal ImmutableList, on server-side it returns an ImmutableList whose contains() method delegates to the backing ImmutableMultiset.

    Fix for Android crash caused by mis-aligned call of Unsafe.getLong on a 4-byte aligned field offset.
    
    Any use of Unsafe to read java arrays of "another type" is dangerous

    conservatively, unless we are running 64-bit java with 8-byte aligned
    byte array offset.  This leaves the Big Java Server optimizations in place.

    Rewrite ImmutableMultiset on Java 7 in terms of the guts of HashMultiset, taking ruthless advantage of its property that it retains insertion order in the absence of removals.

    Rewrite ImmutableMultiset on Java 7 in terms of the guts of HashMultiset, taking ruthless advantage of its property that it retains insertion order in the absence of removals.
    
    This avoids reimplementing yet another hash table, saves some memory -- not as much as an open-addressed table would've, but some, and still keeps us to O(1) total objects -- and saves us some code.  Of course, we've still got lots of code size reduction work to do on HashMultiset, now, but even so this still represents...

    We're still avoiding the potential for a memory leak with the forceCopy part, but we want to avoid the garbage created by slicing the array down to exactly the right size.
    
    We don't ever copy in ImmutableList, since we can only be too big by a factor of 3/2.  In Immutable{Set,SortedSet}, we copy if, after deduplication, the number of unique elements is < array.length / 2.  (And we rebuild the hash table in IS if it's more than twice as...

    Avoid referencing any Ordering methods except natural() in ImmutableSortedSet.
    
    This is a behavior change, but kevinb@ and I agreed that this shouldn't really be detectable -- the handful of users of SortedSet.comparator() don't seem likely to actually do much introspecting on the comparator, and the comparator is equivalent, just no longer an Ordering.

    Make MediaType.charset() a little cheaper.
    
    Since we only care if there are zero or 1 elements we don't need to construct an ImmutableSet at all and so can avoid copying the list.

    Reimplement inCompletionOrder() (courtesy lukes@).
    (Also, make it available under GWT, but possibly I could have done that without reimplementing?)
    
    This is likely to be slightly faster than what we had before. In particular, it means that a directExectur() listener for one output Future can't slow the completion of other output Futures (except to the extent that all Futures-based code is likely to be an interconnected graph in which any directExector() listener can slow any other :)).
    It also means that we complete each output Future in the same thread as the input Future completed. This shouldn't matter to most users, but it could affect people who think they know better than the directExecutor() warnings. (And the resulting improvement to parallelism is one reason for the likely performance improvement noted above, along with the removal of SerializingExecutor's locking.)
    It might also increase the chances that the output Futures actually complete in the same order as the input Futures (though there will always be the potential for races). Users shouldn't care, but it seems like a nice property to provide to the extent that we can easily enough.
    
    If nothing else, it removes the last remaining usage of SerializingExecutor from Guava, which may be nice for minimizing dex size for Android.
    That said, many Android users probably do want SerializingExecutor for their own use. But currently we don't expose ours publicly, so they have their own copy, and they could end up with both ours and theirs -- at least if they use both inCompletionOrder and their own copy, which probably no one does currently. But the long-term solution may be to expose SerializingExecutor publicly, in which case they'd be back to having only one version, and the only people who would benefit would be those who use inCompletionOrder but don't otherwise use SerializingExecutor.

    Annotate some flaky slow tests as @AndroidIncompatible.
    
    These tests appear to have become flakier around CL 148237028 -- probably mostly because it removed @AndroidIncompatible from one method but perhaps because of the changes in implementations of some of the other methods. (I even wonder if changes to the implementations of some tests are causing other tests to fail, given the number of new failures I saw in unrelated tests in my "After" run. Or maybe that's just an artifact of small sample size.)

    Make the tests for Quantiles use up-to-date Truth technology. My main motiviation here is to stop using hasValuesWithin, which is going away. While I'm at it, let's start using comparingValuesUsing for the Map assertions to avoid the unpleasant loop, and inline the helpers, which aren't really useful now that we've done that.
    
    I also fixed testPercentiles_index_computeInPlace() which was being slow (about 100s on my machine, and it was annotated as incompatible with android just for slowness) because it was doing a lot of stuff which wasn't really necessary.
    
    I also added a jsr305 dep which blaze complained was missing if I didn't :-/.

    Allow Funnel<? super T> for BloomFilter.readFrom()
    
    This brings readFrom() in line with create() (as well as the protected constructor that readFrom() delegates to) in accepting Funnel<? super T>.  The existing Funnel<T> requirement is needlessly strict, given that a Funnel<T> is a consumer of T so any Funnel<? super T> should be acceptable.
    
    Relaxing this allows, for example, reconstructing a BloomFilter<String> that uses a Funnel<CharSequence> such as Funnels.unencodedCharsFunnel().

    Instead of using the SortedLists utility class, go straight to Collections.binarySearch in the implementation of RegularImmutableSortedSet.
    
    SortedLists is a much nicer API, but it carries a decent chunk of code weight that we can lose without a problem, and we don't need its fancier features of dealing with multiple elements comparing as equal -- the point of a SortedSet is that we don't have to worry about those.

    {*Graph, Network}.java: change documentation of allowsSelfLoops() and allowsParallelEdges() to correct the type of exception that is thrown when one attempts to modify them in a way that the constraint prevents (e.g., adding a self-loop to a graph that doesn't allow them).
    
    Technically this is a contract change, but in fact the implementations were already throwing IllegalArgumentException, so in practice anyone that was depending on that documentation being accurate (by, say, catching UnsupportedOperationException) was already in trouble, so IMO we should just make this change without trying to worry about backward compatibility; this is just a bug fix.

    Fix "SecretSpecKey" typo in Hashing javadoc
    
    The actual JDK class is named SecretKeySpec, not SecretSpecKey.  Arguably this is confusing since it does implement Key, but then again it also implements KeySpec...

    Fix cases where GWT sometimes couldn't infer which types are serialized.
    And finally revise our (internal-only) tests to catch these problems and the problem fixed by CL 147488537.
    
    As far as I can tell, our old tests passed only because of a GWT bug.
    The fixes are mostly to create dummy superclasses with dummy fields, as usual.
    The exception is ImmutableSortedSet. For some reason, the fix there is to move the existing dummy fields to RegularImmutableSortedSet. My completely wild guess (without investigating at all) is that GWT ignores the ImmutableSortedSet fields because ImmutableSortedSet_CustomFieldSerializer doesn't have the expected methods. This guess makes no sense, especially because GWT appears to be fine with the *Comparator<E>* field on ImmutableSortedSet, just not the E field. Basically nothing makes any sense, but I'm just happy it works now.

    Push down the implementation of createValues() into the subclasses of ImmutableMap.
    
    The only implementations of ImmutableMap that actually use the ImmutableMapValues class are the handful of views like DenseImmutableTable.rowMap().  Pushing down the implementation of createValues() allows us to avoid getting ImmutableMapValues or its dependencies for users just using ImmutableMap directly.

    Eliminate references to ObjectArrays in the closure of ImmutableSet and ImmutableMap.
    
    ProGuard cannot currently eliminate any class that has a static constant that isn't a primitive or String, and ObjectArrays has the EMPTY_ARRAY static constant.  Instead, we'll directly inline empty object array singletons anywhere we need them; Object[0]s will still be singletons, we'll just have different singletons in different places.

    Push down the implementation of ImmutableMap.createKeySet() into its implementations, because ProGuard can't figure out how to eliminate createKeySet even when it's overridden in the only ImmutableMap implementation it knows of.
    
    This makes there be one and only implementation of key sets retained by ImmutableMap itself, RegularImmutableMap.KeySet.  There is no implementation change to the other map types, we just inline the createKeySet() method to those implementations.

    Move the the static constant empty iterator to live in its implementation class, ArrayItr.
    
    This removes the only static constant field from c.g.c.c.Iterators, which allows ProGuard to eliminate it and move its methods to another common location.  Additionally, if we don't reference emptyIterator() or forArray(...) in future, we'll eliminate ArrayItr too.

    Don't use ImmutableSet.of() for the keySet of ImmutableMap.of().
    
    The keySet of the empty map will still be a singleton (since the empty map is a singleton and it caches keySet), it'll just be a different singleton from ImmutableSet.of().  This ensures that the only implementation of ImmutableSet retained by usages of ImmutableMap are its own keySet implementations.

    Delete SingletonImmutableList.
    
    While SingletonImmutableList allocates one fewer object, this isn't worth it on Android.  This has no effect on the MemoryTester bounds for ImmutableList itself.
    
    Currently we are deleting it in all environments, but if we liked we could delete it only in Android; its deletion does increase the MemoryTester bounds for e.g. ImmutableListMultimap, whose "sparse" configuration generates a singleton ImmutableList per key.

    Have ImmutableMaps for zero and one element use RegularImmutableMap instead of {Empty,Singleton}ImmutableBiMap, avoiding pulling in ImmutableBiMap and all its dependencies.
    
    The increase in the size of singleton maps does require an increase in the constant overhead in MemoryTester for immutable multimaps and tables, but a constant overhead isn't worth that much concern.  (We might come back to work on these when we start trying to improve multimap and table size, though.)

    Make RegularImmutableSet extend ImmutableSet directly, not ImmutableSet.Indexed.
    
    The only side effects are that the iterator is slightly more efficient (less indirection), and importing ImmutableSet by itself doesn't import helpers for ImmutableSet views of other collections.  A minor gain, but they add up.

    Make TearDownStack thread-safe
    
    I encountered an issue with some code that starts several servers in
    the background (in parallel), adding a TearDown to stop each one after
    the test is finished. Fixing that issue in the calling code itself
    boils down to basically one of two choices: a. synchronzing my access
    to the tear down stack; or b. restructuring the code so the teardown
    happens on the main thread. Solution "a" is incomplete, as I can't
    protect the access to the stack from code at large (only my code), and
    solution "b" leads to a less-readable, more convuluted code, that
    delays the registering of the teardown to much after it would
    naturally go (and lead to incomplete tear downs, if the test were to
    stop before the moment where the tear down is registered).
    
    Making TearDownStack thread-safe seems like a much better option.

    Among the Futures methods that run user callbacks, those that don't take an Executor will be deleted.  This CL migrates them to the counterparts that take MoreExecutors.directExecutor() as such Executor in the parameter list, exactly the way that the old method works.

    Change NullPointerTester to work for Stream parameters.
    
    The default-generated proxy for Stream instance will throw ClassCastException if the method/constructor calls collect(), which is common.
    
    The reason for the exception is that stream.collect() return R, which the proxy has no idea  that is'a List<T>, or ImmutableList<T> or whatever. That type is unknown because of erasure.

    Annotate AbstractFuture with @DoNotMock.
    
    Ideally we'd annotate ListenableFuture itself, but I don't want to go down the road of fixing or suppressing all existing violations right now.
    I'm doing even AbstractFuture only because it will soon become a subclass of FluentFuture, which we want to be @DoNotMock.

    Fix occasional hangs.
    Also, include LinkedBlockingDeque in our public tests, since we've required Java 6 for a long time.
    Plus, use static imports, Stopwatch, and Truth, and reformat.
    
    The cause of the hang is that sometimes we cancel the producer task before it has even begun to execute. Part of the correct fix is probably to wait longer than 10ms, as martinrb has taught me.... But for the moment, let's at least wait for the task to start before potentially cancelling it.

    guava-testlib: Cover Collections.synchronizedNavigable{Map,Set}().
    
    The tests only cover regular Navigable{Map,Set} behavior for the
    case of wrapping a Tree{Map,Set}. They do not test the fact that
    the wrapper is synchronized.

    Add a "constrainToRange" method to constrain a value to a closed interval.
    
    Equivalent to Boost's clamp function [1] and numpy.clip [2].
    
    Math.min(Math.max(x, min), max) is much more difficult to read and error-prone.

    Update link to GWT docs that died with Google Code.
    
    The best substitute I've found is a commit diff email.
    
    The copy of the page carried over from Google Code to Github doesn't include the relevant information, and it didn't come with history:

    Defer overlap checking in ImmutableRange{Set,Map}.Builder to the build() call, which matches the behavior in ImmutableMap.Builder and allows significantly faster handling of the case where ranges are inserted in predictable order.

    Go back to Collections.sort() instead of List.sort() to eliminate difference
    between forks, since the former just delegates to the latter anyway.
    
    Basically rolls back the part of []that wasn't already
    corrected.

    Note that Guava for Java 8 is coming.
    
    I guess we'll update this again -- possibly along with the Github tagline ("...for Java 6+"), editable (only?) straight from the Github UI -- when we actually release 21.0.

    Fix #1190
    
    Before this fix, splitting a single character input string with a
    Splitter.onPattern instance created with a zero-width regex pattern,
    would have caused the input string to be dropped from the output,
    resulting in an empty iterable being returned rather than a single
    element one.
    
    This fix ensures that the input passes through untouched.
    
    For example, whereas before in this code snippet, 'words' would have
    been initialized as an empty iterable...
    
       String string = "f";
       Iterable<String> words =
           Splitter.on(Pattern.compile("\\b")).split(string);
       // words is empty!

    As currently defined, the hashcode of every unordered EndpointPair which is a self-loop is zero! This is particularly not good for graphs with many self-loops, such as the transitive closure graph, where every node has an incident self-loop. Change hash to use + instead of ^ (this still preserves the property of symmetry, even with overflow).

    Assorted cleanup of cancellation:
    - Eliminate our overrides of interruptTask() (other than one in a test of interruptTask()).
    - Make cancel() final under GWT.
    - Simplify a few tests.
    - Add or improve boilerplate comments about visibility of fields.
    
    We will likely not be able to make cancel() final in general (even if it weren't for our backward-compatiblity guarantees), thanks to certain usages.
    I had hoped that maybe we could in FluentFuture. I suppose that we still could, since we'll offer FluentFuture.from(ListenableFuture), and anyone who needs to override cancel() could override it in the delegate.

    Remove the offset and size fields from RegularImmutableList.
    
    These seemed to be designed to create a faster sublist(), but our base
    implementation of sublist seems likely to be quite similar in performance.
    Plus by eliminating these fields we:
    
    * eliminate a preconditions check and extra field reads on each call to  get(int)
    * save 8 bytes for the fields (and maybe more for alignment on some platforms)
    
    This design seems to be from the very first version of RegularImmutableList and there don't appear to be benchmarks covering ImmutableList.get(),  so this change is somewhat speculative.  I'm curious what your thoughts are.

    Clean up some exceptions. In general, the pattern we try to follow is that if the user provides an invalid argument (e.g. a node not in a graph), we throw an IllegalStateException with a detailed error message. If it's an internal method and something is wrong on our end, we throw an IllegalStateException (and don't usually bother with an error message).

    Avoid duplication of code in ImmutableValueGraph. Surprised I didn't realize this sooner :-/ the backing graph is a ValueGraph, so we can just call through. This also let's us do some other nice things:
    
    1) Get rid of the static methods in AbstractValueGraph.
    2) Get rid of the static method in AbstractGraph. That was actually for a different reason (because of ForwardingObject), but the only thing ForwardingObject did for us was forward the toString() method which we actually *don't* want.
    3) Allow us to "cache" the edge value map, and have both the mutable and immutable implementations inherit that behavior. If someone is calling e.g. graph.edgeValues().get(...) in a loop this should be a noticeable improvement.

    Changes to common.graph. Sorry for the churn, but after this things should be settled down for a while (and we'll be launching v20 soon!). Changes include:
    
    -Revert the interface names back. "BasicGraph" is now "Graph" (BasicGraph was probably a a poor choice), and "Graph" is now "ValueGraph". The "node only" Graph interface is at the top of the interface hierarchy, and ValueGraph extends it.
    -To facilitate the above, the various graph interfaces do *not* specify equality, and the default implementations use reference (identity) equality.
    -Add static methods Graphs.equivalent(...) for users that want value-based equality.
    -Rename Endpoints to EndpointPair. Rename nodeA()/nodeB() to nodeU()/nodeV() and expose isOrdered().
    
    Minor changes:
    
    -Undid the small refactor from [] since the original structure makes it easier for the Immutable classes to have the right hierarchy (i.e. ImmutableValueGraph extends ImmutableGraph, ImmutableNetwork.asGraph() is an ImmutableGraph).
    -Added an "isEquivalentTo" method to NetworkSubject (formerly GraphSubject) in labs. Eventually we should get around to having a single truth import for both Graphs and Networks.

    Fix the serialization of sparse immutable tables.
    
    The 'cellColumnIndices' fields of DenseImmutableTable and SparseImmutableTable
    appeared to serve the same purpose, but were actually slightly different. This

    Make it more difficult to get StackOverflowErrors from hooking chains of futures together with setFuture
    
    There are two ways such an SOE can occur given a chain of AbstractFutures strung together with setFuture
    1 when the 'innermost' future completes, the sequence of directExecutor listeners will all execute inline, recursively
    2 when the 'outermost' future is cancelled, AbstractFuture.cancel() propagates cancellation to the future that has been assigned to it via setFuture since this is 'inline' we can run out of stack
    
    The first one can be solved by modifying the way we execute listeners and detecting this case explicitly
    
    The second one would technically allow for the same solution but a number of users depend on their cancel methods actually getting called so we need to limit this solution to TrustedFuture subclasses and mark TrustedFuture.cancel final.  I can break this change into a separate CL but i thought it might be easier to review altogether, let me know.
    
    This of course doesn't solve every way you could get such a StackOverflowError, just a few potentially common ones.
    
    (This may help with problems like https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2254)

    Add Graphs.transpose() static utility methods for viewing the transpose of a graph. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose_graph
    
    Add Graphs.asBasicGraph(). One downside to having BasicGraph *under* Graph in the type hierarchy (still overall a good idea though :P) is that people are likely to write methods that accept "BasicGraph<N>", even though they COULD accept "Graph<N, ?>". A little bit of javadoc is not going to stop that from happening, so might as well make it less painful to handle. Also, if someone e.g. wants to make a MutableBasicGraph copy of a Graph, there was really no way to do that before. They can now do:
    
    Graphs.copyOf(Graphs.asBasicGraph(myGraph));
    
    Note that we cannot simply change the MutableBasicGraph version of copyOf() to accept a Graph<N, ?>, because then it would have the same type erasure as the MutableGraph version of copyOf() but a different return type. ImmutableBasicGraph.copyOf() has the same issue, because ImmutableBasicGraph extends ImmutableGraph which has it's own copyOf().

    Completely overhaul top-level javadoc for common.graph interfaces in light of the new interface hierarchy. Spend a lot of time answering what I think will be the #1 question users have: should I use a Graph or a Network? Spend a lot less time defining graph theory terms, that's what wikipedia is for :) plus the method-level javadoc defines terms as necessary. Overall, make it a lot more concise. Javadoc that's too long for anyone to bother reading is just as good as javadoc that doesn't exist!

    Optimize directed graphs to consume less memory, at the cost of additional code complexity. Some very rough benchmarks also seem to indicate this has slightly faster runtime. I suspect this is due to improved cache performance/locality when using a single Map.
    
    Memory: Directed mutable graphs consume less memory across the board, with graphs of small degree benefiting the most (memory consumption around 75% of previous). Directed immutable graph memory consumption is more of a wash - going down slightly for graphs of small degree and up for graphs of large degree.
    
    Runtime: Adding a few million edges seems to be about 10% faster.

    Change the definition of hashcode for Networks (map of edges to endpoints) to more closely mirror hashcode for Graphs (map of edges to value). Also the map we're basing the hashcode on is now half the size for undirected networks, which is nice (a downside is that isolated nodes don't affect the hashcode, but I'm not too worried about that).

    Delete the unused, @GoogleInternal copy* methods (in particular, copyNodes, copyEdges, and their Predicate-based counterparts). We're missing the ValueGraph version for all of these, and in the copyEdges case, also the Graph version. The Predicate-based methods have the obvious issue that we'd want to release with the Java-8 Predicate, not the Guava Predicate. copyNodes() and copyEdges() have the unfortunate issue of there not being an obvious correct answer for the whether the source or destination should come first in the parameters. And finally, copyEdges() requires us to decide what to do in the event that the destination graph doe not contain the incident nodes (and neither option is particularly intuitive). Overall, we'd rather not have to support these methods at this point.

    Define equality for Graphs so that a Graph never equals a ValueGraph. This allows ValueGraphs to have the expected behavior when you query valueGraphA.equals(valueGraphB) (i.e. values are taken into account as well).
    
    Since ValueGraph now defines its own equals/hashcode, add AbstractValueGraph to facilitate clients getting this behavior.
    
    Add ValueGraph versions of copyOf() and inducedSubgraph().
    
    Add a package-private ForwardingGraph class for the non-value graph classes (ConfigurableMutableGraph, ImmutableGraph) to use.
    
    Rename AbstractConfigurable* classes to Configurable* (and make non-abstract).

    Move GraphProperties.isCyclic() to Graphs, delete the GraphProperties class. Rename method to hasCycle(), because isCyclic() implies that it might be O(1). Also to be consistent if we ever add other "has" methods (e.g. hasSelfLoop(), hasTriangleSubgraph(), etc.).

    Add the methods Graphs.reachableNodes() and Graphs.transitiveClosure(). Three teams have already implemented similar logic! Also, looking through the remaining uses of the legacy Digraph, the only thing preventing many from being converted to common.graph is the lack of transitive closure. So I'd say there's very high demand for this.

    Endpoints.java: revert language change in Endpoints.adjacentNode()'s exception message; "does not contain" seems more appropriate even though Endpoints is no longer a Collection.  "is incident to" implies that "Endpoints" is really a misnomer for "Edge", which is sort of OK for Graph but not so much for Network, and "contain" works in both cases.

    Flatten the Graph->Network hierarchy. In other words, it's no longer true that a Network IS A Graph. Instead, provide an asGraph() method that allows for viewing a Network as a Graph. Also, update a lot of code that should have been using Graph (instead of Network) to use Graph.
    
    The motivating reasons for this are:
    
    1) Graphs, by definition, do not support parallel edges. So to have Network be a Graph and break that is a little odd. Instead, we can delegate this to asGraph(), stating that the graph will have an edge between node A and B if the Network has an edge between A and B.
    
    2) Equality/hashcode semantics. It was rather unfortunate to require Graph to have explicit knowledge of its subinterfaces, so that they could have their own definition of equality that's incompatible with Graph. With this change, Graph has only one definition of equals/hashcode (like basically every other Java data structure) and subinterfaces (e.g. the upcoming ValueGraph) are expected to follow that.
    
    3) We're going to add an edges() method to Graph, but Graphs will have a slightly different concept of edges than Networks. In a Graph the edges ARE the endpoints, while in a Network the edges HAVE endpoints (and ARE the user-provided objects).
    
    Note that there are a LOT of places where we refer to networks as "graph" in the code. This CL does not make an attempt to change those. It's uncertain whether we want to change those to "network" or continue to use "graph" as a generic term, but that can be handled in a separate CL if necessary.

    Redesign of MapMakerInternalMap with the motivation of saving a lot of memory by not wastefully having stuff that's unneeded. The algorithm (the j.u.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap-inspired segments of hash tables) is untouched.
    
    Memory usage of MapMakerInternalMap is important because it's used under the covers by Interners#newWeakInterner.
    
    The problems the new design fixes
    ---------------------------------
    
    There are four relevant cases of MapMakerInternalMap, one for each combination of weak/strong keys and weak/strong values. The old code implemented all of these exactly the same, from a memory layout perspective. For example, in the worst-case of strong-keys-strong-values, there's the following waste (all numbers assume 64-bit jvm with Xmx < 32G), in decreasing order of severity:
    
    * per-entry: 16 bytes for the StrongReference object
    * per-segment: 32 bytes for the ReferenceQueue object for the values, 32 bytes for the ReferenceQueue for keys, 8 bytes for the storing the references to both of those).
    * per-map: 8 bytes for storing the references to keyStrength and valueStrength, 4 bytes for storing the reference to valueEquivalence (just comes from valueStrength).
    
    For maps with strong values, there's also the minor issue that a new StrongReference wrapper is created whenever the value of a key is changed. This puts unnecessary, albeit probably not that much, pressure on the GC.
    
    The approach
    ------------
    
    We want to get rid of the above waste but we don't want to sacrifice any type safetey. Here's how we do this:
    
    * We introduce four different entry implementations and four corresponding Segment implementations (for each key & value strength pair). These implementations have optimal memory usage wrt the waste discussed above.
    * We introduce a base InternalEntry interface, parameterized on its own implementation (i.e. CRTP - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern). This is so the Segment implementation can be generic in the actual Entry type and still be type safe).
    * We introduce a base Segment class, parameterized on its own subclass (CRTP) as well as on the type of the InternalEntry implementation. The latter is so that the Segment implementations know how to safely efficiently handle the corresponding InternalEntry implementations.
    * And, tying it all together, we introduce a InternalEntryHelper class, parameterized on the InternalEntry implementation type. Specific InternalEntryHelper implementations know how to safely and efficiently deal with the corresponding InternalEntry and Segment implementations.
    * Each of the four InternalEntryHelper implementation classes are singletons (they have no state!). The MapMakerInternalMap has a reference to the specific InternalEntryHelper implementation it needs - this is the _only_ overhead of our approach.
    
    The existing MapMakerInternalMap tests unfortunately poke around into the internals in a hacky and unsafe manner. To continue to support this, we have XXXForTesting methods that do casts and call into the type-safe methods alluded to above.

    Guava's memory benchmark
    tl;dr:
    StrongKeysStrongVals (size = 1M) -> 28.3% memory savings
    WeakKeysStrongVals (size = 1M) -> 24.8% memory savings
    StrongKeysWeakVals (size = any) -> 48 bytes per-map memory savings
    WeakKeysWeakVals (size = any) -> no change

    Update MutableGraph javadoc to state in no uncertain terms that there can only be a single edge connecting a pair of nodes. Delete TODOs regarding parallel edges for Graphs, which we will not do.
    
    Regarding motivation:
    
    1) Having a Graph with parallel edges complicates things a fair bit. There are certain assumptions you can make about graphs without parallel edges that you cannot make about graphs with parallel edges. Given that we don't even expose an "allowsParallelEdges()" method, there's literally no way to future-proof yourself if we did later add Graphs with parallel edges. We'd just break a lot of code.
    
    2) In order for a Graph with parallel edges to actually make sense, we would have to expose several additional methods (at the least, getEdgeCount(nodeA, nodeB), setEdgeCount(nodeA, nodeB), and allowsParallelEdges()). Given that Graph is supposed to be the simpler interface, this would be unfortunate.
    
    3) With my proposed ValueGraph interface, a ValueGraph<N, Integer> would be exactly analogous to a Graph<N> with parallel edges, but with clearer semantics. However, I feel points #1 and #2 are sufficient to resolve this matter.

    Rename NodeConnections to NetworkConnections and NodeAdjacencies to GraphConnections. Have a base interface called "NodeConnections". This change is just cosmetic right now (although we do refer to these things as "connections" everywhere, so it's nice to actually have "NodeConnections" be the base interface), but it will make more sense in the context of ValueGraph (there will be a ValueGraphConnections).
    
    However, I think this change is worthwhile (or at least not harmful) even outside of ValueGraph. And a rename like this, if bundled like with a large functional CL, will clutter things up a lot.

    Remove the public equal/hashCode/toString methods from Graphs. There are a variety of reasons for doing this:
    
    1) No other class in Guava does this. For example, there's no Sets.hashCode() or Multimaps.equals().
    2) The instanceof checks and casting is annoying, and would only get substantially worse if we introduced an additional core interface. Yes, this is hidden from the user, but might as well take advantage of polymorphism and avoid it entirely.
    3) Reduced API surface area. I don't like exposing multiple ways to do the exact same thing. The user shouldn't have to wonder "hmm... is Graphs.equal(foo, bar) always going to give me the same result as foo.equals(bar)?".

    Delete the ImmutableSet.copyOf() inside edgesConnecting() for immutable networks. Three main points here:
    
    1) The comment is no longer true. edgesConnecting() used to be evaluated as the intersection of two sets, but is now done differently (we did add a unit test to make sure they're equal though!).
    
    2) With the introduction of "SimpleEdgesConnecting", in the no parallel edges allowed case, this is already super efficient (i.e. everything is O(1)). There's no need to wrap it in an immutable set.
    
    3) With the introduction of "MultiEdgesConnecting", even in the parallel edges allowed case, methods such as .contains(), .size(), and .isEmpty() are all O(1) if successors() has been invoked. We lose the O(1) runtime of those methods if we always make an immutable copy of the set first.

    Update the javadoc for the MutableGraph/Network interfaces. Update three things:
    
    1) Remove the reference to "optional operation". This was before the mutation methods were split out into Mutable* interfaces. Now that they are, the language doesn't really make sense - if an implementation didn't support it they just wouldn't implement the Mutable interface! jrtom@ mentioned the possibility of e.g. a MutableGraph that only supports adds but not removes. This is possible, but seems relatively unlikely, and it's not like this stops them from throwing UOE. I just don't think it's worth mentioning in the javadoc any more.
    
    2) Mention what the default behavior of addEdge() is. My coworker using graph for the first time was trying to figure it out, and was frustated because he had to dive into the implementing class logic to figure it out (and it wasn't particular easy). We should just state up front what we do.
    
    3) Make it clear when addEdge() will throw an IllegalArgumentException. We no longer have to add clarifying javadoc in the implementing classes.

    Update edgesConnecting().size() and edgesConnecting().isEmpty() to be more efficient for Networks with parallel edges. In particular, take advantage of the cached successor multisets. Currently the methods are always O(D). This will also be O(D) if successors hasn't been invoked, but will be O(1) for future calls. For example, with something like:
    
    edgesConnecting(n1, n2).size()
    edgesConnecting(n1, n3).size()
    edgesConnecting(n1, n4).size()
    ...
    
    All calls after the first will be O(1), as it invokes successors(n1). This makes it so that, if someone has a dense graph with O(N^2) edges, calling edgesConnecting().size() or edgesConnecting().isEmpty() on every pair of nodes is O(N^2) (i.e. amortized O(1)) rather than (N^3).

    Make ImmutableNetwork.copyOf() more efficient in the case of directed networks that allow self loops. Sets.intersection().size() is linear in the size of the first set, whereas this is O(1) assuming degree() is O(1) (which at least in our impl, it is).

    Remove the method Graphs.roots(). “roots” as we’re defining them isn’t really a standard term of art (I can only find references to ROOTED graphs, which have exactly one root). Additional reasons to remove:
    
    1) It's super easy to implement yourself, either inlined as you're processing nodes or as a static method.
    2) The definition is even weirder for undirected graphs.
    3) If we have this method, we should have also have the parallel method "Set<N> leafs(Graph<N> graph)". However, "leafs" is not well-defined in graph theory. It can either mean "nodes with an out degree of zero" OR "nodes with a degree of one".
    4) There's only 1 real caller. Technically there's 2, but one of them seems to have a bunch of methods that are dead.

    Update definitions of equals() and hashCode() for Graph/Network. The new hashCode() shouldn't change any behavior (of course) but should be more efficient for directed graphs. equals() does change behavior in certain corner cases (see [] but it was arguably broken before. To keep things simple, we now flat out say directed != undirected.

    Add the method Graphs.endpoints() that does what you expect: returns the endpoints corresponding to each edge in a graph. The whole "we print every edge in an undirected graph's toString() twice, and that's a feature not a bug *wink*" annoyed me. Also there's other cases, such as copyOf() and and getWeaklyConnectedComponents(), where we don't want to process each edge twice. In those particular cases they happen to be no-ops, but for cases where it's not, or where you do something computationally expensive, doubling up on undirected edges is bad :(

    Avoid using MapRetrievalCache unless node lookup is expensive. The class constructs "CacheEntry" objects when adding to the cache, which if the cache is not used makes us slower, and even if the cache is used is roughly a wash speed-wise if map lookup is fast (e.g. a HashMap or ImmutableMap, and an object with a reasonable hashCode()).

    Move oppositeNode() from Graphs to Endpoints and rename it otherNode(). Also make a few methods final. It changes the following code:
    
    Graphs.oppositeNode(graph, edge, node);
    
    to this:
    
    graph.incidentNodes(edge).otherNode(node);
    
    The oppositeNode() method in Graphs always kind of bugged me. It takes three parameters, which is a lot for a utility method. More importantly, the last two parameters were both of type Object, with no "obviously correct" ordering, so it was easy to accidentally swap them and get a run-time error. Finally, with the introduction of the Endpoints class, this moves the method to the more logically correct place. Someone looking for this method was probably already dealing with incidentNodes() and Endpoints. It makes a lot more sense to say "hey, sorry you can't call target() since this is undirected, try otherNode() instead!" if it's in the same class.
    
    In terms of the change itself, the more fluent style seems like a big win. And there's not even a burden to third-party implementations of Graph/Network, because we will have the only implementations of Endpoints (the constructor is private). So I see only positives and no negatives for this change.

    An optimization for Graphs and Networks, inspired by Michael. Introduce "MapIteratorCache" and "MapRetrievalCache". MapIteratorCache is extremely light-weight and optimizes the follow case:
    
    for (N node : graph.nodes()) {
      graph.foo(node);
    }
    
    while MapRetrievalCache is slightly heavier and additionally optimizes the following cases:
    
    graph.foo(node);
    graph.bar(node);
    
    OR
    
    graph.foo(node1);
    graph.foo(node2);
    graph.bar(node1);
    graph.bar(node2);

    Automated g4 rollback of changelist 125826869.
    
    *** Reason for rollback ***
    
    The class-level Javadoc for the top-level interfaces is going to be refactored soon, and I don't want to lose these comments in the process.
    
    *** Original change description ***
    
    I was reading through the class-level javadoc (which could use some cleaning up, but I think jrtom said he's working on that), and this passage struck me. The latter two options don't seem like something that would actually happen. For example, we allow nodes of any type, so an impl where the nodes store the topology and cannot be shared across graphs doesn't really make sense.
    
    Even beyond that, this just seems like low-level implementation stuff that users of the Graph/Network interfaces shoul...

    Mention getOnlyElement() as an alternative in the Javadoc for getFirst().
    
    This came up in my Java readability review ([]as I had been
    aware of getFirst() but not of getOnlyElement(). Indeed, I think many of the
    cases where it's valid to only look at one element from an iterator are
    actually cases where there's only one element in the iterator, and so I suspect
    I won't be the only person who's using getFirst() when they are really looking
    for getOnlyElement() instead.
    
    This CL also reformats the rest of the Javadoc for getFirst() to 100 characters
    to be consistent with the new paragraph that I added.

    Also, change copyOf() slightly to have separate impls for the predicate and non-predicate versions. The non-predicate version can be slightly more efficient by avoiding incident node containment checks when adding edges.

    Even beyond that, this just seems like low-level implementation stuff that users of the Graph/Network interfaces shouldn't have to care about.

    More safety checks when adding and removing edges, plus simplify the code. Rather than return a boolean, addEdge now asserts that it *always* add an edge (we avoid calling it at all if it wouldn't). Similarly for removing edges, removeEdge() now asserts that it always removes an edge - unless the graph is undirected and it's a self-loop edge.

    Make degree(node) on directed networks O(1) instead of O(D), at the cost of a teensy bit of memory (a self loop counter). In actuality it doesn't seem to take up any extra memory, perhaps due to how the object is padded/aligned. Additionally, this CL makes iterating through incidentEdges() slightly faster on directed networks if no self-loops are present. In the undirected case, adding and removing self-loop edges is now slightly faster.
    
    Note: this CL makes it so that every call to *degree(node) is O(1), as explained here:
    
    degree(node)
    directed graphs: we store a map that combines predecessors + successors
    undirected graphs: easy
    directed networks: now O(1) :P see description above
    undirected networks: easy
    
    outDegree(node)
    directed graphs: we store an explicit successor count
    undirected graphs: same as degree(node)
    directed networks: easy, we store an out edges map
    undirected networks: same as degree(node)
    
    inDegree(node)
    directed graphs: we store an explicit predecessor count
    undirected graphs: same as degree(node)
    directed networks: easy, we store an in edges map
    undirected networks: same as degree(node)

In the case of no parallel edges allowed, it's actually O(1) (thanks to [] Given that, I think it makes sense to just remove the statement entirely.

    Regarding Java 8: we'll want to minimize the code differences between the two versions of Guava, and avoiding repeating a 3 line static method doesn't really seem worth the difference.
    
    Allowing users to specify the expected degree is in direct opposition with specifying expected edge count, since given two out of (node count, edge count, degree) you can always derive the third. Specifying node/edge count seems like the most reasonable combination, and it's what's already implemented.

    Interrupt the producer thread instead of assuming it will exit naturally.
    If the SynchronousQueue producer doesn't try to put() in time for the consumer to accept the value, it hangs forever.
    The result is a flaky test.
    
    As part of this, I've removed the producer's ability to fail the test if it's interrupted.
    That's because I need to be able to interrupt the SynchronousQueue put() operation.
    I could find a way to continue to fail on interrupts in other cases, but it doesn't seem valuable enough to be worth the trouble.

    Delete the TODO to "try creating an abstract superclass that NetworkBuilder and GraphBuilder could derive from."
    
    I investigated this, and although it's possible, you get almost no benefit from it. There's only 3 rather trivial methods that end up the in the abstract class (4 if we eventually allow parallel edges on Graphs), and the subclasses still have to override them to scope the return type (you don't want to actually return the abstract base class to the user!).
    
    If the method names were buildGraph() and buildNetwork() instead of just build(), it would be much more reasonable.  Then we wouldn't need an abstract class at all and NetworkBuilder could extend GraphBuilder. But I don't think the extra verboseness for callers is worth being able to simplify some code on our end. Also, I don't think being able to use a NetworkBuilder to build Graphs (not Networks) is an ability anybody particularly wants.

    Make a couple of optimizations to UnsignedLongs.toString(x, radix):
    
    * If x > 0, use Long.toString. The JDK code is essentially the same for radices other than 10, and is much faster for 10.
    
    * If radix is a power of two, use shifting and masking instead of division and remainder.
    
    * If radix is even, simplify the initial division that extracts the last digit.

    Add some validation to predecessor/succesor counts. This should also catch the unlikely (impossible?) case where there are more than Integer.MAX_VALUE predecessors or succesors. Alternatively we could change these to longs, but that adds ~8 bytes to every node, and I'm already pretty sure a HashMap cannot hold more than 2^30 entries.

    Update documentation for Interners.
    Since Java 7, the String.intern() does not allocate the strings in permgen, but instead on the heap (in a table whose bucket size is configurable using XX:StringTableSize).

    Make mutable directed graphs about 40% smaller. Another nifty benefit: directedGraph.adjacentNodes(node).size() is now O(1). Remove (unused) equals/hashcode impl from NodeAdjacencies.
    
    Interestingly, this does make immutable directed graphs slightly larger. The exact % depends on the degree of the nodes. inDegree == 1 and outDegree == 1 is a particularly large increase because two SingletonImmutableSets is much smaller than one ImmutableMap with two entries.

    Reduce the memory usage of Networks by roughly 20%. Delete the IncidentNodes class. Remove (unused) equals/hashcode impl from NodeConnections. Additionally, removeEdge() is now O(1) in all cases (used to be O(D) for networks with parallel edges). edgesConnecting() is now O(1) for networks that don’t allow parallel edges (used to be O(D), even though a network without parallel edges cannot return > 1 edge for this method).

    "subType" -> "subtype"

    "Subtype" is one word, according to various dictionary and to our usage in public methods on TypeToken and MediaType.
    "Supertype" is not as 100% clear in the dictionary, but when a dictionary or other document mentions it, I see it as one word. I also see precedent in "Class.getSuperclass."

    Currently, SomeClass<?>.getSubType(SubClass<?, OtherT>) returns SubClass<?, OtherT>.
    However, if we do NotGeneric.getSubtype(SubClass<OtherT>), we get SubClass as a raw type instead of
    SubClass<OtherT>.
    
    If we fix that bug, then as it turns out we weren't generating proper owners for static classes, so fix that too

    Graph.java: break out mutation- and edge-specific methods into subinterfaces:
    * Network.java: edge-specific methods (extends Graph)
    * MutableGraph.java: mutation methods for Graph (extends Graph)
    * MutableNetwork.java: mutation methods for Network (extends Network)
    Graph<N, E> becomes Graph<N>.
    
    Consequential changes:
    * adding various new Network-specific classes (NetworkBuilder, AbstractNetwork, etc.)
    * adapted Graph-specific classes to remove edge-related code
    
    Note: Graph does not currently support parallel edges.
    
    Motivations:
    * Make graphs without explicit, first-class edge objects available.
    * Remove mutation methods from the top-level interfaces so that Graph/Network objects supplied as their parameters don't (contractually) support modifications.  (And so that the slightly differing signatures for Graph and Network mutation methods don't cause user confusion.)

    Remove hardcoded graph toString() tests. Instead, simply verify that every node and edge appears in the graph's string representation. This is done for a few reasons:
    
    1) It gives us a false sense of test coverage. For example, getPropertiesString() is used in both the actual code and the test code. If there was a bug in getPropertiesString none of the tests would catch it.
    
    2) Any minor tweak to the graph string format, which should be an easy change, requires touching a lot of tests.
    
    3) The biggest reason: incidentNodes() on an undirected graph makes no guarantee of order. As such, a test should not hardcode the expected toString() result. Multiple string representations of the same graph are equally valid.

    Make all AbstractFutures behave like TrustedFutures under GWT.
    
    I'm doing this for two reasons:
    
    1. Exceptions are almost certainly disproportionately expensive under GWT. But mostly...
    
    2. I can get away with under GWT, where there are very few users of util.concurrent. (This is technically a violation of our compatibility policy, but I suspect we've played a little fast and loose with it when it comes to GWT before. Plus, util.concurrent is likely to be even less used outside Google than it is inside, and it gained GWT support only in Guava 19. And to top that off, I hope to remove Future.get() entirely from GWT, so this CL will be the least of users' worries :))
    
    Also, update a comment in ImmediateFuture.

    Steer users away from dereference().
    
    Questions:
    - Should I steer them away even more strongly? Should I be trying to delete this method?
    - Might we want Callables.submit(Executor, AsyncCallable)? This is a moderately common use of dereference(). https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2076

Author: jasexton <jasexton@google.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 18 19:22:02 2016 -0700

    Major refactoring of the com.google.common.graph APIs (including updates to client code):
    -Remove DirectedGraph and UndirectedGraph interfaces; a Graph's directedness can now be queried with graph.isDirected().
    -Remove GraphConfig class; use the query methods directly on the Graph interface instead.
    -Add GraphBuilder; use this instead of Graphs.create[Un]Directed(GraphConfig)
    -Remove ImmutableGraph.Builder; ImmutableGraph construction is now done with ImmutableGraph.copyOf(Graph).
    -Rename multigraph() to allowsParallelEdges(boolean).
    -Rename noSelfLoops() to allowsSelfLoops(boolean).
    
    Old example syntax for creating a graph:
      DirectedGraph<N, E> graph = Graphs.createDirected(GraphConfig.multigraph());
    
    New example syntax for creating a graph:
      Graph<N, E> graph = GraphBuilder.directed().allowsParallelEdges(true).build();

    Specify behavior with self-loops in degree() javadoc.
    
    Wikipedia states: "the degree (or valency) of a vertex of a graph is the number of edges incident to the vertex, with loops counted twice". I've found several primary sources that also state the same. But Wolfram has this definition: "The degree of a graph vertex v of a graph G is the number of graph edges which touch v" with no mention of self-loops.
    
    With directed graphs it would be easy to get this behavior (just return inDegree + outDegree), but with undirected graphs you would either need to store more information than we currently do or make this an O(D) method instead of O(1). Overall I'm not sure how many people care so probably not worth changing, but at least worth calling out in the javadoc.

    This change replaces usages of static final fields on CharMatcher, e.g. CharMatcher.WHITESPACE, with the equivalent static factory method, e.g. CharMatcher.whitespace().
    
    The change is being made so that we can remove the static final fields, primarily because they must be eagerly initialized, causing many implementation classes (which may be unnecessary) to be loaded. This is a significant performance problem on Android. Using methods allows implementation classes to only be loaded when actually needed, as well as matching our long-standing preference for factory methods over public fields.

    Fixes, standardizations, and noise reduction in Futures tests.
    
    - Run more tests under GWT (and fix some @GwtIncompatible reason documentation). This required no actual changes to the tests except...
    - Make testSuccessfulAsList_resultCancelledRacingInputDone look at the correct logger now that we've moved most listener execution to AbstractFuture.
    - Retrieve that logger with getLogger() rather than from the class under test's `log` field.
    - Use TestLogHandler instead of our custom throwing handler.
    - Move RuntimeExceptionThrowingFuture out of FutureCallbackTest, and use it in FuturesTest instead of our hacked up solutions that happen to work today.
    - Test both overloads of get() for some immediate*Future() implementations.
    - Go crazy with static imports, even by my standards.
    - Rename expected exceptions to "expected," and remove comments about their expectedness.
    - Remove descriptions from fail() calls.
    - Remove a redundant immediateFuture() test.
    - Use Truth in a few places.
    - Use getDone() for various reasons:
      - It will let tests work under GWT if I remove get() there.
      - It sometimes saves us an isDone() assertion.
      - It prevents some tests from hanging in the case of a bug.
      - It doesn't declare `throws InterruptedException`, so in theory, we might be able to remove some `throws` clauses. (But I haven't done so.)
    - Add a getDoneFromTimeoutOverload() with a custom GWT implementation to prepare for losing timed get() there.
    
    Left for later CLs:
    - reformatting everything
    - splitting FuturesTest into separate classes

    Prevent fail() from being ignored by the surrounding catch() block by throwing new Error().
    
    Tests of a testing API often look like this:
    
    try {
      runATestThatShouldFail();
      fail();
    } catch (AssertionError expected) {
    }
    
    However, the catch() block can catch not only the expected failure from runATestThatShouldFail() but also the "test did not fail when it should have" failure from fail().
    
    This an automated fix using Error Prone ([]
    
    We intend to make this a compilation error in []'s Java compiler,
    so it is necessary to fix existing occurrences first to avoid breaking
    builds.

    Also, make immediateCancelledFuture() available under GWT, since I use it in the new tests.
    To use cancellationExceptionWithCause() from it, I had to move that method out of the server-only AbstractFuture.java and into the shared Futures.java.
    This runs somewhat counter to my effort to make Futures.java smaller. Maybe we'll want a Util/Helpers class, though I'm not quite sure what else would go in it (executeListener? currently non-static maybePropagateCancellation?).

    Make classes support entry.setValue:
    - CompactHashMap
    - LocalCache
      - Support was removed in [] and I'm not sure why.
      - The private documentation still claims that it's supported.
      - A test (that I edit in this CL) checks that it's not, but presumably only because it was copied from a test that looked for the old behavior and thus needed to be updated: http://[] | []

    When displaying the actual class name, use the simple name.
    (Note that GWT has supported getSimpleName() since 2.6.0.)
    
    We started doing this for the expected class name in CL 115380685 by passing literal strings like "IllegalStateException" to the constructor.
    But I also made some changes to make this more obvious.

    Never return a (Sorted|Navigable|Bi)(Map|Set) from the plain (Map|Set) overloads.
    
    Prior to this CL, the plain overloads performed instanceof checks, delegating to the (Sorted|Navigable|Bi) versions when possible.
    
    The old behavior is probably The Right Thing, but it hinders Proguarding.

    Encourage users to use framworks instead of chaining things together manually.
    
    As part of that, I tried to clarify the significance of using ListenableFuture "as an input to another Future." I don't love what I've ended up with, but I'm not optimistic that I'll do better anytime soon.
    One part of *that* was switching part of the doc to the second person simply because I couldn't find a good way to make it flow otherwise. I ended up propogating this to more of the doc, and I think it's probably a small net improvement.

    This change replaces usages of static final fields on CharMatcher, e.g. CharMatcher.WHITESPACE, with the equivalent static factory method, e.g. CharMatcher.whitespace().
    
    The change is being made so that we can remove the static final fields, primarily because they must be eagerly initialized, causing many implementation classes (which may be unnecessary) to be loaded. This is a significant performance problem on Android. Using methods allows implementation classes to only be loaded when actually needed, as well as matching our long-standing preference for factory methods over public fields.
    
    Tested:
        TAP train for global presubmit queue

Author: lukes <lukes@google.com>
Date:   Mon Feb 29 11:54:00 2016 -0800

    Add overloads to Preconditions checkState,checkArgument and checkNotNull to avoid boxing and varargs for the most common parameter combinations.
    
    This adds primitive overloads for all combinations of Object,char,int and long up to 2 parameters and Object only overloads up to 4 parameters.  This covers 92-98% of formatting calls based on an analysis of googles codebase.
    
    This change is fully binary compatible but only mostly source compatible.  It is possible that this cl will call some Preconditions calls to become ambiguous with respect to overload resolution.  For example this call
    
    void foo(Boolean condition, short s) {
      checkState(condition, "%s", s);
    }
    
    will fail to compile with this change.  There are two simple changes to the invocation that will resolve the ambiguity.  'condition' can be explicitly unboxed, or 's' can be explicitly boxed.  We believe that such situations will be incredibly rare.
    
    See the JLS 15.12.2 for full information on overload resolution: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.2

    Make Iterables.unmodifiableIterable() and Iterators.unmodifiableIterator() methods accept (Iterable|Iterator)<? extends T> instead of (Iterable|Iterator)<T>. Some of our unmodifiable*() methods already did this (e.g. unmodifiableMultiset(), unmodifiableBiMap()), and the "? extends T" signature is consistent with the unmodifiable*() methods in Collections.java.
    
    Note that SortedMap only does it for values, not keys, due to the various Key-typed methods that return views in the interface. Maps.unmodifiableMultimap() also has some issues that at the very least make it tricky (maybe impossible, didn't investigate enough to be sure) to follow this pattern.

    Fix 6-year-old test bug.
    
    The bug is:
    
      try {
        somethingThatShouldFail();
        fail();
      } catch (AssertionFailedError expected) {
      }
    
    The fail() is masked by the catch() block.
    I've requested an enhancement to Error Prone to catch this: https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/393
    
    Additionally, I improved IteratorTester under GWT: IteratorTester couldn't catch wrong-exception bugs there because of GWT's lack of reflection. This was a known, documented limitation, but the tests still attempted to verify its ability to do so. When I fixed the test bug, they broke. I then realized that I could just fix IteratorTester to work under GWT. It's probably even a simplification.

    Introduce AbstractGraph. This is a bare-bones base class that all Graph implementations should be able to extend (analogous to e.g. AbstractSet for Sets). It ensures there is consistent equals()/hashCode() across different Graph implementations. Additionally, this CL drops the requirement that two graphs have to have "the same type" to be equal.

    Reduce memory footprint of mutable graphs by roughly 10%. Considering the increase that [] yielded, getting this back down is definitely good.
    
    This is done by using HashSets instead of LinkedHashSets for the various internal data structures stored in NodeConnections. Note that we still maintain insertion order on nodes() and edges(), because those are the keysets of LinkedHashMaps. As "outer level" structures (i.e. only 1 per graph), making those HashMaps instead of LinkedHashMaps would have a relatively small effect on memory footprint compared to changing the many "inner level" Sets inside NodeConnections.
    
    As for the question of whether we WANT to maintain insertion order, that's not what we were doing anyway, and implying it is what we were doing could be dangerous if someone relies on it. For example, the order in which nodes becomes predecessors or successors to other nodes can be completely different from the order in which the nodes were inserted to the graph. So there is no consistent ordering of nodes, each call to predecessors() or successors() will yield a different "ordering" than that of nodes(). To complicate the matter even further, there are methods like incidentEdges() and adjacentNodes() on directed graphs. These are simply the union of two other sets, which by its nature will not preserve any ordering (a union iterates over the elements in set1, followed by the elements of set2 that were not in set1), so we have yet another inconsistent "ordering". For now, I propose we should only guarantee insertion order on a graph's nodes() and edges(), and not any other accessors.
    
    As a side note, of the two problems mentioned, the former will not be a problem when we allow "sorted nodes/edges" because the inner Sets can simply be TreeSets as well, preserving the same ordering as the outer level TreeMaps. The implementation of Sets.union() will still prove to be problematic, but the implementation could be presumably be modified to support SortedSets if we want to guarantee that any Set<N> or Set<E> accessor will be sorted if the Graph is created with a Comparator<N> or Comparator<E>.

Author: jasexton <jasexton@google.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 4 11:15:15 2016 -0800

    Make Graphs.oppositeNode() slightly more efficient. It performs the same number of equals checks (1 in self-loop case, 2 otherwise) but without the additional call to contains() - while still providing the incidence check.
    
    Also, make it work on the base Graph type. This will be necessary in order to call it from our base abstract graph implementation.
    
    And finally, add test coverage, for which there was apparently none!

    Remove incorrect javadoc regarding "passing the smaller Set first" from Sets.union().
    
    In Sets.intersection() this comment makes sense, since it iterates through set1 as the "main set", and does a contains check against set2 for every element in set1. So iterating through intersection() is O(|set1|) for HashSets, or O(|set1| * log|set2|) for TreeSets. For the union() case though, I don't believe this comment is correct. Iterating through the union involves:
    
    -Iterate through set1. No contains checks are performed. This is simply O(|set1|) (assuming the Set has normal iteration performance)
    -Iterate through set2. For every element, a contains check against set1 is performed. Thus we have O(|set2| * C1), where C1 is the cost of a contains() call to set1.
    
    So if set1 is a HashSet we have O(|set1|) + O(|set2|). Order makes no difference. If set1 is a TreeSet we have O(|set1|) + O(|set2| * log|set1|). This is actually *worse* when set1 is the smaller of the two sets.

            AbstractMutableGraphTest   AbstractImmutableGraphTest
             |                    |
             v                    v
    AbstractDirectedGraphTest   AbstractUndirectedGraphTest
    
    to the following:
    
                          AbstractGraphTest
                            |           |
                            v           v
          AbstractDirectedGraphTest   AbstractUndirectedGraphTest
                      |                             |
                      v                             v
    AbstractImmutableDirectedGraphTest   AbstractImmutableUndirectedGraphTest
    
    Unfortunately the lack of multiple inheritance in Java means we have to choose between whether we want inherit from a base "immutable graph test" or get all the functionality of the base "(un)directed graph" test. Both involve some amount of code duplication for full test coverage, but I think this is the better option of the two given that the (un)directed tests are likely to have more tests added over time, whereas a base immutability test is unlikely to be expanded much (the tests for this are currently repeated between AbstractImmutableDirectedGraphTest and  AbstractImmutableUndirectedGraphTest).

    This change replaces usages of static final fields on CharMatcher, e.g. CharMatcher.WHITESPACE, with the equivalent static factory method, e.g. CharMatcher.whitespace().
    
    The change is being made so that we can remove the static final fields, primarily because they must be eagerly initialized, causing many implementation classes (which may be unnecessary) to be loaded. This is a significant performance problem on Android. Using methods allows implementation classes to only be loaded when actually needed, as well as matching our long-standing preference for factory methods over public fields.

    This change replaces usages of static final fields on CharMatcher, e.g. CharMatcher.WHITESPACE, with the equivalent static factory method, e.g. CharMatcher.whitespace().
    
    The change is being made so that we can remove the static final fields, primarily because they must be eagerly initialized, causing many implementation classes (which may be unnecessary) to be loaded. This is a significant performance problem on Android. Using methods allows implementation classes to only be loaded when actually needed, as well as matching our long-standing preference for factory methods over public fields.

    Improve performance of nested calls to Iterables.concat() and Iterators.concat() *without* using any additional memory. This CL brings the runtime from O(D^3) to O(D^2), where D is the nesting depth of concatenation.
    
    It appears this issue was previously discussed here:
    http://code.google.com/p/google-collections/issues/detail?id=151
    
    But no work was done to fix it other than adding some javadoc to Iterators. While still not as fast as unnested concatenation (which is linear), this seems fast enough that a javadoc warning is no longer necessary - especially considering the warning was only in Iterators and not in Iterables, even though both exhibited the cubic runtime and there are 13x more calls to Iterables.concat() than Iterators.concat().

    Optimize PairedStatsAccumulator.addAll(PairedStats). If we update the xStats before we update sumOfProductsOfDeltas, instead of after, so that we use the new value of (values.xStats().mean() - xStats.mean()) instead of the old value, then we absorb two of the factors in the product, and save ourselves a multiplication and a division.
    
    This seems like a straight win, and also makes the code look more like that in the add(double, double) method.

commit 00d42155755bb7748fce8ca27a7109afc0a05d49
Author: peteg <peteg@google.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 6 03:25:16 2016 -0800

    Change StatsAccumulator.addAll(Stats) to use a more Knuth-like calculation for the mean. I claim that this is more accurate in the cases we care about.
    
    We know that this method is more accurate when adding a single value to an accumulator which has accumulated a large number of values (see Knuth for the background). I believe that it is generally more accurate when we are adding a small number of values to a larger number. It may be less accurate when the two datasets are comparable in size. But I claim that we care about the former more than the latter.
    
    As a motivating example, think turning a double into a Stats of a single value, and then merging the Iterator<Stats> into a single Stats using this new method. The aggregation will happen hierarchically: typically, there will be a first phase on the mapper where we combine individual values on a given shard, and a second phase on the reducer where we combine values from the various shards. In the first phase, we're combining a lot of Stats each with a single value, so this is actually equivalent to the case where we're adding a single value, and the Knuth method is definitely more accurate. In the second phase, we can expect to be combining similarly-sized Stats instances from a large number of shards, so the process will be dominated by the case where we're adding one shard's values to many shards' values, which is adding a small number to a larger number.
    
    Anything where we're combining more than a few similarly-sized Stats instances will benefit from this change.
    
    This CL also makes a tiny tweak to add(double): instead of incrementing count and then branching on count==1, it branches count==0 and increments (or sets to 1) inside both branches. This is probably more readable (because it's easier to understand "are we starting from an empty accumulator" than "are we creating an accumulator with one value"), it improves the symmetry between the two methods, and there's an outside chance it could be faster (if the compiler/hotspot create better code for comparing to zero).

    Add @GwtIncompatible annotations to top-level classes.
    Our previous policy was: "Look for a @GwtCompatible annotation. If it doesn't have one, then it's not GWT-compatible."
    
    But maybe it's better to be explicit in both cases?
    If nothing else, it might let us write tests that everything is annotated one way or the other, so we would have to actively annotate something wrongly to get the wrong outcome.
    But the real motivation is that this gets us a step closer to relying on the GWT compiler's @GwtIncompatible stripping internally (as we already do externally) instead of our own.
    
    Do note, though, that I haven't fully annotated everything:
    - I've skipped c.g.c.base.internal.Finalizer, where I'm not sure it's safe to depend on @GwtIncompatible or even to declare a special copy. (It has a test that forbids nested classes, but maybe I could put a copy in the internal package as a top-level class?)
    - I might have just missed stuff that was added since I first created the first version of this CL back in, like, 2013. (This is actually part of my motivation for submitting it: I keep having to do enormous syncs with annoying merges. I want to stop carrying these changes around in a client.)
    
    I've left all of the reasons (that is, the annotation values) blank.
    We decided that this was OK in API Review.

    Write compare method in a way that won't look buggy to Error Prone.
    
    This change modifies Java compare methods that are using int casts from longs in
    a usually broken way. Int casts in Java will truncate a long value and
    consequently may alter the sign of the value being cast. Compare methods may be
    implemented using a subtract, iff values are known not to be near overflowing
    limits. When the values are longs you can get:
    
    int compare(MyLongHolder other) {
      return (int)(other.x - x);
    }
    
    As the cast won’t preserve the sign of the subtract it is buggy and can lead to
    broken sort orders.

    To generate random hashable things, use Random instead of Object hash codes.
    
    Apparently Object hash codes are not particularly random on Gingerbread, under which we run our tests (though they're better by Marshmallow).
    Perhaps the "best" hash functions can deal with this, but we've seen a few hash functions that sometimes generate more collisions than our tests permit.
    
    This made their tests flaky.
    
    I couldn't identify any particular reason for the use of hash codes over Random.

    Make a slight tweak to the way we calculate means in StatsAccumulator. We pull out a variable for (value - mean) instead of computing it twice. This also means that we no longer need the old mean to compute the change in sumOfSquaresOfDeltas, we only need the new mean, so we can update mean directly instead of storing nextMean. We end up with the same number of temporary variables and the same calculation but one subtraction fewer and (perhaps more importantly) we do the computations in a more natural order.

    We probably don't need to test this case at all, but I've kept it around for now and just explained why it's kind of unfair to begin with.

    Fix calls to contains(Object) and get(Object) that pass a value of apparently the wrong type.
    Tighten up some generics in other cases to make the type, which was correct after all, look more correct.
    
    BUGS:
    
    AbstractBiMapTester:
    - Fix inv.entrySet().contains(...) check, which was using the forward entry instead of the reverse.
    - Fix getMap().get(v) call to be an inv.get(v) call.
    - Use |reversed| instead of |entry| consistently for clarity.
    
    TypeToken:
    - Call map.get(K) instead of map.get(TypeCollector).
    (Presumably this was just an optimization and not necessary for correctness?)
    
    SIMPLIFICATIONS:
    
    TypeResolver:
    - forLookup always returns a (nullable) TypeVariableKey. Declare that return type instead of plain Object.
    (benyu@: I feel like we may have talked about this, with your expressing a preference for the Object type. But I can find no record of the discussion, so I could be making that up. If you do prefer Object, I won't push for the change.)

    Add a third AtomicHelper strategy to abstract future
    
    This should only be used when getDeclaredField(String) fails (used by AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater).  afaik classes are always allowed to reflect on their own private fields so this should never happen.  But some Samsung 5.0.x android devices have bugs in the reflection APIs that can cause this to happen.  As yet reproducing such failures has proven elusive, it is thought that this failure mode may depend on address layout randomization or possibly a flaky bug in the ART compiler.

    Start running the tests for guava-testlib under Android.
    This revealed the usual minor problems and also a new test bug in ForwardingWrapperTesterTest: The sample buggy forwarding class was buggy in *two* ways instead of the intended one. Not only did it forward to the wrong method in one case, but it also reversed the order of parameters in all cases. Android happens to test its methods in a different order than the JVM, so it detects the reversed parameters first. I've fixed this by fixing the parameter order.

    Reduce Bloom filter size again to reduce (eliminate?) flakiness.
    (In fact, CL 106839287, while it claims to remove a value that's "no longer meaningful," seems to have made the flakiness worse. This fits with the comments on the CL that suggest it has effects -- specifically, an increase in wall time. Since that CL, this test has been failing 100% of the time instead of just the vast majority of the time, though it's possible that the timing is a coincidence.)
    This test has also been causing problems for our coverage build:

    Suppress new CollectionIncompatibleType Error Prone check by casting
    incompatibly-typed argument to query methods in generic collection types.
    This will enable us to make this pattern an error in [], preventing
    future occurrences of this bug.
    
    REVIEWERS TAKE NOTE: We are *not* fixing this bug.  Fixing it requires making
    a behavioral change, and we need your team to assume any risks associated
    with that. Please approve this CL, so we can enable the new compiler error
    and prevent future occurrences of this bug.
    
    Background:
    
    Various generic collection types have methods that take Object rather than the type parameter you would expect, e.g. Collection#contains. Consider a
    Collection<String>.  If someone invokes contains() on that collection and
    passes in an argument of type Integer, it can never return true because the
    Collection cannot contain any Integers.
    
    This CL changes places where these methods are called with an incompatible
    type by casting the argument to the declared type of the method, such as
    Object or Collection<?>.  **This does not fix the bug.**  It is
    semantically-equivalent code that bypasses the Error Prone check so that the
    code will continue to compile after we enable the check in the compiler.
    Fixing the bug mechanically is not feasible because the fixes are too complex,
    but we want to prevent more instances of this bug from entering the codebase.

    future occurrences of this bug.
    
    REVIEWERS TAKE NOTE: We are *not* fixing this bug.  Fixing it requires making
    a behavioral change, and we need your team to assume any risks associated
    with that. Please approve this CL, so we can enable the new compiler error
    and prevent future occurrences of this bug.
    
    Background:
    
    Various generic collection types have methods that take Object rather than the type parameter you would expect, e.g. Collection#contains. Consider a
    Collection<String>.  If someone invokes contains() on that collection and
    passes in an argument of type Integer, it can never return true because the
    Collection cannot contain any Integers.
    
    This CL changes places where these methods are called with an incompatible
    type by casting the argument to the declared type of the method, such as
    Object or Collection<?>.  **This does not fix the bug.**  It is
    semantically-equivalent code that bypasses the Error Prone check so that the
    code will continue to compile after we enable the check in the compiler.
    Fixing the bug mechanically is not feasible because the fixes are too complex,
    but we want to prevent more instances of this bug from entering the codebase.

    Fix buggy test identified by CollectionIncompatibleType.
    The test was calling get(class) instead of get(typeToken).
    The test still passes, since it was expected a null return value -- exactly what it gets for a key that isn't present.
    I've also added containsKey() and entrySet().contains() checks to verify that the null value really is present.

    Automated g4 rollback of changelist 105235264.
    
    *** Reason for rollback ***
    
    It turns out this doesn't fix the Guava issue. As such, I think it's probably preferable to keep the count != 0 check as it prevents unnecessary work when there are no entries in the segment. I have another fix in progress that seems to work.

    For public Guava only, rely on the GWT compiler's built-in @GwtIncompatible stripping instead of our custom stripping.
    The custom stripping dates from the days before GWT 2.6.0 added it to the compiler: http://www.gwtproject.org/release-notes.html#Release_Notes_2_6_0_RC1
    This change has been possible for a while, since Guava has required GWT 2.6.1 since Guava 18, but we hadn't had the motivation.
    Now we do: This lets us avoid checking the stripped sources into Github, which lets us avoid mixing stripped and handwritten sources, which lets us simplify our MOE inverse mappings.
    Internally, we will continue to rely on the custom stripper for now.
    
    Mechanically, all we're doing is:
    - Remove all the stripped sources from public Guava (by removing the build rules that put them into Guava).
    - In Maven/Ant, copy *all* GWT-compatible sources, whether fully GWT-compatible or not, into our GWT resources. Those that aren't fully GWT-compatible either have supersource emulations (in which case the main sources will be ignored under GWT's usual supersource mechanism, as they are now) or simply require the built-in @GwtIncompatible stripping (in lieu of the previous custom stripping).

    Remove more possible static-init deadlocks (https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1977).
    
    - ImmutableSortedMultiset: I couldn't figure out a way for this to actually deadlock, but I figure it's best for it to follow the pattern of the others.
    - ImmutableSortedSet: This might be able to deadlock if one thread creates a RegularImmutableMap (which then calls into RegularImmutableSortedSet and then ImmutableSet) while another initializes ImmutableSortedSet (which then calls into RegularImmutableSortedSet).
    - ImmutableTable: This might be able to deadlock if one thread GWT-deserializes a SparseImmutableTable (which then calls into ImmutableTable) while another initializes ImmutableTable (which calls into SparseImmutableTable).

    Move many implementations out of Futures.java (https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2091).
    Mostly I've moved them to new classes, but I've also moved rejectionPropagatingExecutor to MoreExecutors (unmodified except for a new null check).
    
    This also revealed that the GWT copy-pasted catching/catchingAsync code was missing use of rejectionPropagatingExecutor. This is now fixed.

    Ensure that ByteStreams.skipFully/skipUpTo don't skip more bytes than remain in the stream.
    
    This is a horrible thing that is possible with FileInputStream in JDK7, despite that it violates the contract of InputStream.skip. The solution (which we were already doing in our method for counting a stream via skip) is to never ask to skip more bytes than the stream reports as available().
    
    This does unfortunately change skipFully to skip by reading when the InputStream always returns 0 from available() (the default behavior if it isn't overridden), but as far as I can tell it's necessary to ensure correct behavior.
    
    This issue is causing test failures under JDK7 with the recent change to the behavior of ByteSource.slice.

    Allow slicing a ByteSource starting at an offset that is >= the source's total size.
    
    In this case, the sliced source will be empty. Previously, the call to slice() would succeed but an exception would occur when the user attempted to read the returned source. There is precedent for this behavior: FileChannel/SeekableByteChannel allow setting the channel's position beyond the end of the file, in which case reads return EOF.
    
    This is a change to existing behavior, but I think it's probably a good change to make:
    
    - Previously, it was unspecified what happens if offset is >= source.size. Now it's specified.
    - Previously, a call to slice could succeed but return an (effectively) invalid ByteSource that would always throw.
    - The override of ByteArrayByteSource.slice is currently using this behavior, because I thought that was the behavior that the normal slice implementation was already using. I could change that, but I think this is preferable.

    - Strip comment reference to @ForOverride, which was impeding import stripping.

    Convert much of Guava to Truth by using Refaster.
    
    The motivation was my wish for a better ThrowablesTest error message in https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2130 (though I'm pretty confident that the problem there is \n vs. \r\n).
    I made a lot of changes, but I left a lot undone. In particular, I avoided most of the collection assertions, since we often want to test specific collection methods. e.g., we don't necessarily want get() to be rewritten to containsKey().

    Automated (partial) g4 rollback of changelist 100047098.
    (only the testlib parts, and excluding UnmodifiableCollectionTests, where we still need a workaround for Android's toArray() bug)
    
    *** Reason for rollback ***
    
    No longer a problem now that we put test infrastructure in a separate dex (CL 100842219) and suppress searching for tests in that dex (CL 100849889).
    
    *** Original change description ***
    
    Spray @SuppressUnderAndroid on everything related to suite builders and nested test classes.
    Also:
    - Work around Android toArray() bug in UnmodifiableCollectionTests.
    - Stop referring to NavigableMapTestSuiteBuilder / ListTestSuiteBuilder in comments of ForwardingNavigableMapTest.java / ListsTest.java. The reference impedes the import stripper.

    Loosen up our nefarious Entry tests to permit an exception so long as the nefarious entry can't harm the underlying collection.
    If a nefarious Entry really wants to throw an exception, we can't stop it, since it could also do it from getKey() or getValue().
    
    This fixes the test under Android.

    Suppress tests under Android.
    - I've suppressed nearly everything that might be calling Type.equals(). At some point, we can try to figure out whether we can interoperate with Android's Type.equals() just as we do with JDK7's. Or we can at least be more surgical in our suppressions; this CL sprays them everywhere.
    - I've suppressed a bunch of URLClassLoader-using tests. I'm not sure that custom URLClassLoaders make a lot of sense on Android.
    - I've suppressed some suite() methods, as I haven't managed to get the test-suite builders working under Android.
    - ForwardingObjectTesterTest may show limitations of ForwardingObjectTester under Android, or it may a sign that we just need to call setAccessible or something. But since ForwardingObjectTester is just a package-private testing utility, I haven't dug into it.
    - I've commented a test in RateLimiterTest that may fail for similar reasons in newer versions of Android.
    
    A general point about c.g.c.reflect: Reflection is slow on Android, so it's unlikely that users will be making significant use of this package. For this reason, I don't see further work on Android testing of the package as a priority.
    
    (Note that we don't actually run these tests on Android at HEAD. This will be changing soon.)

    Suppress tests under Android.
    - ByteStreamsTest.testNewDataOutput_writeChars may show a legitimate bug, whether in our code or in the Android library.
    - CloserTest.testCreate looks up the JDK version. We should update this to look up the Android version if applicable.
    - Android seems to have trouble with:
      - nested test classes
      - test classes without default constructors (which are necessarily constructed in suite() methods).
    
    I've also improved some failure messages in ByteStreamsTest.

    Suppress tests on Android.
    - BigInteger and BigDecimal appear to be buggy on Android (at least Gingerbread, where I'm testing now, since we claim to work with it).
    - Some c.g.c.math utilities appear to be failing there, presumably because of other Android bugs, but I suppose it's conceivable that there's something wrong with our code. Ideally we will investigate further at some point, perhaps after testing on newer versions of Android.
    
    Also, check in some of the failure-message improvements I put together while debugging.

commit 6ef4550c792a47b91ff7fa60a60a7a2765178eb1
Author: cpovirk <cpovirk@google.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 31 07:17:44 2015 -0700

    - Stop manually stripping @MediumTest. MOE has stripped it automatically for a while. Remove end-of-line comments that were interfering with stripping in this particular case.
    - Strip @Flaky with strip_line instead of begin_strip/end_strip.
    
    Both of these are minor simplifications, and that's nice. But also...
    
    I ran into a bad interaction between (I think) MOE's "strip elements with this annotation" stripper's heuristics and its comment stripper. I started stripping @MediumTest-annotated attributes from a special internal "Guava for Android." MOE's annotation heuristics appear to strip the end_strip comment but not the begin_strip comment. I guess that it's stripping everything from the first method annotation -- surely the right thing to do but a pain in this case. This causes MOE to strip everything from there to the end of the file. As it turns out, there's not much left to strip. But it strips the closing }, so that fouls everything up.

    Optimize the GWT TimeUnit library in terms of performance.
    
    Background:
    Long divisions in GWT are expensive because there is no "long" type in Javascript and the GWT emulates them. When the TimeUnit library is used in a hot loop, it causes perfomance issues.
    
    Solution:
    The long divisions are extracted into precomputed constants.

    Work around a type inference change in javac
    
    The javac compiler's behavior when handling wildcards and "capture" type
    variables has been improved for conformance to the language specification. This
    improves type checking behavior in certain unusual circumstances. It is also a
    source-incompatible change: certain uses of wildcards that have compiled in the
    past may fail to compile because of a program's reliance on the javac bug.

    Fix guava test breakage due to GWT internal changes.
    
    For some reason Guava tests call into GWT internal implementations.
    
    I ported guava to use Arrays.copyRange instead of GWT's internal arrays methods. These
    methods should never be called from any code outside of GWT's core module.

    Eagerly check for an appropriate exceptionClass constructor during calls to Futures.getChecked.
    This way, callers that pass a bad exceptionClass find out unconditionally instead of only when their Future fails.
    
    (Retry of CL 97776570, rolled back in CL 97787294 because of a breakage that has since been addressed. I've made two tweaks: I've improved the error message (to minimize confusion, and I've migrated to the standard J2ObCIncompatible annotation (as done elsewhere already),
    
    We hope for bad exceptionClass parameters to soon be caught at compile time.
    
    To keep performance acceptable, cache a set of classes with appropriate constructors.
    Use ClassValue, which was introduced in JDK7.
    Do the compatibility dance, including making Animal Sniffer happy by annotating the class that uses ClassValue.
    That requires updating Animal Sniffer to a version that respects the annotation in more places, perhaps related to http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MANIMALSNIFFER-29
    I've also updated the Animal Sniffer signatures on the theory that newer is probably better, although there is no apparent no impact on Guava.
    
    The cost of the eager check is performance in the success case: What used to take ~1.6ns will now take ~3.2ns. This is likely to be swamped by the actual work being done and by other overhead (like threads). (This was discussed and approved in API Review.)
    The ClassValue implementation is faster than the fallback version, particularly in the unlikely case in which users call getChecked() with many different kinds of exception types.

    I seem to recall some weirdness around adding suites to themselves -- like, the tests were getting run even without the self-add call except in some unusual case like when you requested a run of a specific class with --test_arg/--test_filter?

    Add static factory methods to CharMatcher equivalent to the existing constants.
    
    Also do some significant reorganization, primarily extracting anonymous CharMatcher implementations to named nested classes and grouping them together at the bottom of the file. This makes it easier to look through the various methods in CharMatcher without being swamped by implementation details of individual matchers. It's also needed for the constant implementations to create a place to put a static final INSTANCE field (which will allow the implementations to be effetively constants, but also lazily loaded, once we remove the constant fields.

    Check that size and iteration are consistent with isEmpty after map.clear().  BiMapTestSuiteBuilder failed to catch an error of this type in HashBiMap, though other tests fortunately caught it.

    Use key insertion order in HashBiMap.
    
    This bumps memory consumption back up to equal a pair of HashMaps; the shared entries in both directions are just enough to pay for the linked list.  On the other hand, we're not actually allocating any additional objects, so this shouldn't be a significant loss for Android.

    Fix a lock ordering deadlock in CustomScheduler reported in https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2072
    
    The issue is that CustomScheduler uses a lock to atomically reschedule after each iteration, unfortunately this lock has inconsistent ordering with respect to the lock used by AbstractService.  In particular for a RUNNING service the following can ocurr
    
    T1:
    service.stopAsync()
      -> AbstractService.stopAsync() [ ACQUIRE AbstractService.monitor]
         -> AbstractService.doStop()
            -> CustomScheduler.cancel() [ ACQUIRE CustomScheduler.lock]
    
    T2:
    CustomScheduler.reschedule() [ ACQUIRE CustomScheduler.lock]
       (getNextSchedule throws an exception)
      -> AbstractService.notifyFailed [ACQUIRE AbstractService.monitor]
    
    Boom deadlock!
    
    It looks like i introduced this deadlock in https://github.com/google/guava/commit/2c0727049d7e7cbbe1febf5bcf6b7a4b1860dea5 though it is possible it wasn't an issue at the time since the AbstractService implementation was different
    
    The fix was to simply move the call to notifyFailed outside the lock.
    
    I have similar concerns about the other lock in this class, but i believe it actually is safe (though we should probably remove it anyway, as per an ancient TODO)

    Move cancellation propagation from cancel() to done().
    
    Advantages:
    - We are no longer a blocker to making AbstractFuture.cancel() final. Realistically, that will never happen, but maybe we can make FluentFuture.cancel() final when it comes along?
    - cancel() is not the only way to cancel: setFuture(cancelledFuture) also works, bypassing any propagation logic defined in cancel(). This is probably fine in practice: Once setFuture() is called, there's generally no need for additional propagation logic. Still, it feels cleaner to me.
    - The "read to local, then cancel, then use local" dance is error-prone (<[]Extracting a method happens to simplify things.
    
    Disadvantages:
    - The method has to be defined in both copies of AbstractFuture (GWT and non-GWT). We could work around this by introducing a superclass or by making it static.

    Fix a race:
    If one input fails at nearly the same time and with the same exception as the *first* failure, we sometimes log the exception, even though it's already propagated into the output.
    The problem is that the first failure lets subsequent failures proceed before it registers itself in seenExceptions.
    It does register itself with setException(), but we don't have full atomicity because we have two sources of truth.
    (This is why we have a problem only when the first failure is involved: Other failures atomically manipulate seenExceptions.)
    The solution is for whichever caller initializes seenExceptions to propagate it with the value from setException().
    This is a little messy but hopefully not too bad.
    (It comes with a small bonus: It happens to avoid allocating seenExceptions entirely if there is only one failure.)

    directExecutor() scaretext, take 152.
    
    This revision consists mostly of being less specific about the circumstances in which bad things happen and more specific about the effects of the bad things.
    
    If we like this, we can decide whether it belongs here or on directExecutor() itself, and we can link to it from Futures.transform, etc.

    Remove the test code from TypesTest that tries to ensure that Types.newTypeVariable functions correctly in the presence of a SecurityManager.
    
    It isn't really possible to test this fully given that the security-sensitive operation happens in a static initializer.

Author: cpovirk <cpovirk@google.com>

    Aggressively null out references when invoking the transformation/fallback.
    
    This probably won't matter for the Function overloads. (But in theory the GC could recognize that the remaining references in local variables are unused. And we could null those out if we want, too.)
    It is more likely to help with the AsyncFunction overloads. There we are more likely to let inputFuture (and possibly a chain of its own dependencies) be GCed long before the derived future completes, since the whole doTransform/doFallback stack frame is often destroyed before the setFuture call bears fruit.
    
    One other advantage: If we screw up and try to access the fields instead of the local variables, we get an error always instead of only in rare cases.

    Rename AbstractCatchingFuture.running to "inputFuture."
    This matches AbstractChainingFuture.
    The "running" name was more appropriate in the days that it used to sometimes contain the fallback future.
    That was necessary for cancellation at the time, but now that's handled by our use of setFuture().

    See https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1312 (we were holding off on the
    de-@Beta'ing because we wanted to remove the public constructors).
    
    The only other API change we might want to make is to add toString(TimeUnit)
    (https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2007) but that shouldn't stop us from
    de-@Beta'ing it now, right?

    Some enhancements for Futures.transform and Futures.catching
     * extract a template method and 2 subclasses from CatchingFuture and ChainingListenableFuture.  This will allow us to eliminate asAsyncFunction() and 2 allocations per transform
     * make CatchingFuture implement Runnable and save a Runnable allocation
     * have CatchingFuture/ChainingListenableFuture clear all their fields on cancel, which should prevent pinning the transformers
     * have rejectionPropagatingRunnable short circuit for directExecutor() which should save 2 allocations for users who prefer to pass directExecutor() explicitly
     * have Futures.catching use the rejected execution exception logic when it makes sense

    In TypesTest, change the check for correct functioning in the presence of a SecurityManager. Previously we had a SecurityManager that refused Method.setAccessible except in a few well-known places, the intent being that one of the places it would refuse would be the use in Types.TypeVariableInvocationHandler that we wanted to test. But that proved to be fragile. Instead, we explicitly refuse that place, and we check that the refusal happened. This builds more knowledge of the implementation into the test, but should be more robust.

    Enable tests that are newly runnable under GWT:
    
    - some immediateFailedFuture tests, which we missed when making immediateFailedFuture work under GWT.
    - some tests that uses TestLogHandler now that TestLogHandler works under GWT.
    
    Also, rename a logger variable to reflect the recent CombinedFuture->AggregateFuture rename.

    Make TestLogHandler GWT-compatible.
    
    GWT doesn't have synchronizedList, so I switched to |synchronized|. The small performance difference shouldn't matter much.

    Migrate users calling new LinkedHashMap(int) to
    Maps.newLinkedHashMapWithExpectedSize when it appears that that is what they
    actually want.
    
    new LinkedHashMap(int) sets the size of the internal hashtable to the given
    size, but usually callers really just want a hash table that is large enough
    for a given number of elements.  newLinkedHashMapWithExpectedSize does exactly
    that.

Date:   Thu Apr 16 12:14:06 2015 -0700

    Refactored Scanner.onJarEntry() and onResourceFile() to scanJarFile() and scanDirectory().
    
    Advantages discussed sofar:
    
    1. scanJarFile(JarFile) and scanDirectory(File) leaves no room for ambiguity. Questions like "are manifest files, directory resources filtered out?" won't be asked because it's up to subclasses.
    
    2. scanDirectory() can potentially be more efficient when searching for a particular package for example. You wouldn't even need to recurse into c/g/common if you are only interested in c/g/foo.
    
    3. scanJarFile() can use JarFile.entries() and loop over. It's an existing API that we don't need to provide an alternative way to traverse through Jar file entries.
    
    4. scanDirectory() can use either Files.fileTreeTraverser() or java.nio.file.Files.newDirectoryStream(). So we shouldn't expect too much boilerplate duplication.
    
    5. If a client doesn't like to silently ignore unreadable sub directory, it doesn't have to.
    
    Disadvantages include inconvenience for the subclass compared to implementing the bare-bone onJarEntry() and onResourceFile().

    Add a method that tells how many permits are stored and can be used without blocking future tryAcquire calls.
    
    Successfully acquiring permits when the rate is set to near zero causes all subsequent tryAcquire calls to fail even after setting the rate really really high. For our use-case we don't want to ever incur this penalty and would instead want to only acquire if we've stored up enough.

    Fix ClassPath by exposing Scanner for internal clients to customize.
    
    This change slows down CodeInspectionTest. But it exposes Scanner for it to extend and memorize the urls.
    
    Basically, the test should create its own ClassInfo class (name + url).
    
    And subclass ClassPath.Scanner as:
    
    class MemorizingScanner extends ClassPath.Scanner {
    
      private final ListMultimap<String, ClassInfo> classes = ...;
    
      @Override void onResourceFile(ClassLoader loader, String packagePath, File file) {
        if (file.getName().endsWith(".class")) {
          classUrls.put(packagePath + file.getName(), new ClassInfo(resourceName, url));
        }
      }

    When a new entry exceeds the segment's maxWeight all by itself, don't bother evicting anything else, only the new one. Still go through all the motions of actually adding and evicting it; otherwise I fear the code complexity will skyrocket.
    
    In a sense this starts us down a path of trying to make weight-based eviction "smart", and it's not clear where that should end up, but I think this seems like a logical special case no matter what.

    Make implicit narrowing compound assignments explicit.

    In com.google.common.reflect.Types, make the Method objects that are used as part of Java compatibility accessible.
    
    Making them accessible should not be necessary, since they are being used to access package-private methods from elsewhere in the same package. But having them not accessible trips over an unfixable race condition in App Engine. There, the security layer intercepts reflective operation and ultimately ends up invoking the Method from another package. To make this work it has to do Method.setAccessible(true) in a try/finally. But if two threads end up doing this at the same time then one may set the Method back to inaccessible just after the other has set it accessible. Making the Method always accessible avoids this problem. It is not any kind of security problem since the methods in question are harmless and the only reason they are not public is to avoid polluting the API.

    Deprecate get(), which is being replaced by getChecked().
    
    Nearly all callers have been migrated. Callers who use guava_jdk5 will be stuck on the deprecated method for now. We'll migrate them when getChecked() becomes available in guava_jdk5.

    Fix some things this turned up:
    
    - Remove a couple benchmarks for APIs that aren't public in Guava.
    - Remove LoadingCache benchmarks that compare a LoadingCache to MapMaker.makeComputingMap, which is package-private now.
    - Fix a usage of diamond operator that snuck in.
    - Remove CombinedFuture from Futures, since the methods that use it are internal-only.

    Collect all resource URLs in the ResourceInfo objects.
    
    Essentially ResourceInfo.url() is analogous to Class.getResource() and now
    ResourceInfo.urls() provides analogous support for Class.getResources() with the benefit that it is significantly faster (ClassPath was already calculating these as part of scanning).
    
    This is yet another attempt at trying to add a way to see alternate resources to classpath.

    Refer to the old names of transformAsync and catchingAsync from their @since tags.
    
    We have done this elsewhere, e.g., "@since 9.0 (in 1.0 as {@code compose})"
    It should make migration easier for anyone who skips over the version of Guava in which the old method was deprecated.
    It should also help both internal and external users who go looking for the old name.

    Inline the implementation of DoubleMath.mean rather than using a helper class. This is called inside loops often enough that I think it's worth avoiding the object assignment. Also improve the javadoc.
    
    This code is basically all copied from Stats.meanOf, where it was reviewed, so hopefully it shouldn't be too controversial.
    
    (For background, we accidentally --- it was my fault --- ended up with DoubleMath.mean and Stats.meanOf duplicating the same functionality. One of them needs to go, and it seems clear this one should survive, since it's already in guava and it's not even @Beta. But I want to make sure this one has the improvements from the other.)

    Seperate tests for GoogleInternal methods into their own class
    
    Some of the tests in javatests/com/google/common are run not
    just against the java/com/google/common code but also against
    Guava. This is fine as long as the tests do not test any
    code marked as @GoogleInternal because they break as the
    code to test does not exist in Guava.
    
    This change breaks up test classes that break when run against
    Guava into separate classes, one for running against internal
    and Guava and one just to run against internal.
    
    This is part of the work to upgrade guava_jdk5 to v17.

    Fix after rollback changelist 84974387.
    
    Added documentation and test that SerializingExecutor ignores interrupts,
    since javatests/com/google/apps/framework/concurrent/ListenableStreamTest.java assumes
    that should be the case.
    
    I am not convinced that this is correct because it effectively disables the normal mechanism for shutting down an executor.
    
    *** Original change description ***
    
    Add some functionality to SerializingExecutor and rework its code.
    
    Add functionality to suspend the execution. Intended primarily for cases where we want to wait
    for an rpc before continuing execution....

    Add a few final(?) tests.
    
    Most are tests of null handling, since our automated null tests don't run under GWT.
    I've added checkNotNull() calls where appropriate.
    
    One is to verify that a failing listener doesn't interfere with other added listeners.
    
    I also added a test of get() with a negative value, as concurrency classes generally permit:
    "All methods that accept timeout parameters treat values less than or equal to zero to mean not to wait at all."

    Add and use helper methods like assertDone() in tests.
    This found no bugs -- well, maybe one if you count the inconsistent propagation of interruption from the delegate, though I had suspected as much already.
    
    Add another "misbehaving listener" test, this one for the case in which the Future is already done.
    This found a bug, which I've fixed.

    Test no-arg get() on pending Futures, even in a non-GWT setting.
    To prevent from hanging forever, of course, we need to spin up another thread to make the call.
    Conveniently, we already have the code for this lying around. The main thing I did to it was change it to call getUninterruptibly, since we handling interrupts isn't worth the trouble here.

    Short-circuit future.setFuture(TrustedFuture) in GWT, too.
    
    If anything, I would expect the gains of avoiding "new ExecutionException(...)" to be greater than GWT than in "normal Java."

    Take advantage of new GWT AbstractFuture tests to enhance overall AbstractFuture testing:
    - Run the tests not just under GWT but also under "normal Java."
    - Run the test as part of our open-source build (which happens mostly "automatically" as part of the above change).
    - Expand the tests to run with a TrustedFuture input and a non-TrustedFuture input. Currently this matters only in non-GWT mode, but I expect that to change in time.

    Pass a Locale to String.format calls.
    Then, run Guava tests in locale hi-IN to catch future dependencies on the default locale.
    Finally, as a convenience in debugging problems, write Maven logs in UTF-8 rather than ASCII. (This is likely already the case in "normal" Maven runs, but our guava_moe_test target was stuck on ASCII.)
    
    This CL covers all the String.format calls in Guava, fixing <https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1567>. There are many other calls in internal com.google.common code. We may want to consider additional testing and avoidance strategies, e.g., a RootLocale.format convenience method and an error-prone check for no-Locale calls.

    Adds a small clarifying comment to the Javadoc of common.cache.RemovalListener.
    
    My team was previously assuming that calls to CacheLoader.load and RemovalListener.onRemoval would always be paired, but we found out this is not the case.
    
    In retrospect, the existing Javadoc already hints at this, but I think it can be made a bit more explicit.

commit 52bd26004ad769bb698e649ff88fb70b47e12567
Author: cpovirk <cpovirk@google.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 8 12:03:25 2015 -0800

    Standardize that Functions.foo().toString() returns "Functions.foo()." (I've preserved two existing exceptions: compose(b, a) (which returns "b(a)") and forMap(map, default) (which returns "Functions.forMap(map, defaultValue=default)"). I don't know whether that's ideal, but it doesn't feel worth spending too much time worrying about.)
    This matches what Predicates.foo().toString() and Ordering.foo().toString() return.
    
    (Also, remove some unnecessary toString() calls from Predicates.java. Those changes would have been made in CL 58115976 (successor to CL 56242188) except that that change was made concurrently with a CL just like the one you're reading but for Predicates (CL 59050444).)

    setFuture documentation tweaks:
    - Describe cancellation propagation.
    - Stop referring to setFuture as though it *always* "sets asynchronously."
    - Small tweak that I'm not sure actually helps: change "previously been set or cancelled" to "already been set or cancelled." Somehow I feel like this is marginally clearer that it refers to "done at the time of the setFuture call" rather than "done at the time the supplied Future completes." Am I crazy? Maybe I should just say "done at the time the supplied Future completes?"
    - Maybe other stuff I've forgotten.

    (1) Don't use a lock for seen exceptions field; should help speed a little (saves space in the non-error state)
    (2) Track not only seen exceptions, but also the causal chain.
    
    Good example of unnecessary logging from this is a CancellationException, which is wrapped in another CancellationException on list futures.

    Add a more efficient implementation of Sets.symmetricDifference.
    
    Background: was looking through the Guava code and came upon a TODO.
    
    An even more efficient implementation could involve using a special consuming iterator to first return the items that are in set 1 but not in set 2, and then add the items from set 2 that weren't consumed (because they aren't in set 1); however, that would either modify the original set or have to use more space.

    Fixed isAssignableFrom() for <? super T> wildcard types, as pointed out by Guava issue 1898.
    
    In a nutshell, here's what we have in the current implementation:
    
    List<? super String>.isAssignableFrom(List<Object>) == true // Correct
    <? super CharSequence>.isAssignableFrom(String) == false // Wrong!
    <? super String>.isAssignableFrom(<Object>) == true // Wrong! Not assignable
    
    To show why they are wrong, consider the following three code snippets where the first two compile and the third doesn't compile:
    
    void okay(Receiver<List<? super String>> receiver, List<Object> objects) {
    receiver.accept(objects);
    }
    
    void okay2(Receiver<? super CharSequence> receiver) {
    receiver.accept("1");
    }
    
    void notOkay(Receiver<? super String> receiver, Object obj) {
    receiver.accept(obj);
    }

commit 353ae349a24fb6c9b3e233ca03e4012761c7f3d8
Author: lukes <lukes@google.com>

    Rewrite AbstractFuture to fix the following issues
    
    1. set,setException and cancel are all potentially blocking methods
    2. using AbstractQueuedSynchronizer is overkill for a future
    3. the lack of a setFuture method leads to a lot of repetitive code
    4. abstract future is fat
    5. timed get() calls will always succeed if the future is done when the blocked thread wakes up, even if the deadline has passed.
    
    The approach is to directly implement the interface using Unsafe and LockSupport.
    
    ExecutionListBenchmark is written to essentially generate as much thread contention as possible... im not sure how useful it is.  Also, the more i try to run multithreaded (micro) caliper benchmarks the less confident i am that any of the data is reliable.  The main point is that the future is definitely much smaller and also faster in most scenarios.

    Fix shutdown issue in AbstractScheduledService.
    
    The issue is that if stopAsync() was called after an interation had been
    executed (but before it had actually run) then we would fail to unlock
    our lock and then shutdown would hang forever.

    Remove the array copy from Fingerprint2011.hashBytes(byte[], int, int) method.
    
    Conclusion: for hashFunctionWithOffset the improvements are visible in terms of bytes used, but also in terms of execution speed (before: 297,340; after: 173,506). Interestingly enough, there are small improvements for the hashBytes without offset version (before: 184,860; after: 164,804).

    This CL fixes null annotations in com.google.common.primitives
    
    The annotations on the tryParse() methods are inconsistent. Many of them don't have @Nullable annotations. This is problematic, because: a) the method can return null; and b) the package itself is annotated with @ParametersAreNonnullByDefault. This causes Eclipse to display dead code warnings when checking the return value from these methods.
    
    I've included the @CheckForNull annotation, since I saw you guys using it already. Technically, this isn't required and @Nullable by itself should be fine. But it doesn't hurt to have both. Also Eclipse doesn't understand @CheckForNull.
    
    I also threw in a few @Nullable on equals() methods that were missing.

commit e7f902c768e974552f954a1a55970d6ef39dc6fb
Author: Chris Povirk <cpovirk@google.com>
Date:   Mon Sep 15 08:26:48 2014 -0700

    Fixed a FreshValueGenerator bug that causes failure in generating fresh values recursively when there are finite number of distinct values provided by user.
    
    The fix is to make sure the "freshness" AtomicInteger is only incremented at the end of generating a fresh value for user code. Recursive generation of values for nested types (such as generating the K and V for a Map<K, V>) doesn't increment the freshness.
    
    This ensures that for finite set of distinct values, we don't ever skip distinct value.
    
    Along the way, the special casing for Optional had to be changed. So I just spent extra effort supporting an @Empty annotation that can be used to generate "empty" value for any arbitrary type.
    
    Originally, I tried to return empty collections. But some existing tests failed because the classes don't always like being injected with empty collections or maps (they may have a precondition check to reject empty collection).
    
    So @Empty is only applied to Optional, Range and ConcurrentMap.

    Modify SmoothRateLimiter so that the ratio between maximum-permits-per-second and minimum-permits-per-seconds can be specified -- currently this ratio is hard coded to 3.
    
    This makes it much more flexible as "ramp up limiter" aka "acceleration limiter".

    GWT: Better error checking, logging, and documentation.
    - Error checking: I had been trying to enable compilation with -strict (<https://gist.github.com/Abdennebi/2828230>). However, while the GWT compiler parameter is "-strict" and the Maven system property is "gwt.compiler.strict," the Maven parameter is "failOnError:" <http://mojo.codehaus.org/gwt-maven-plugin/compile-mojo.html#failOnError>. Additionally, while the compilation goal supports failOnError, the test goal does not: <http://mojo.codehaus.org/gwt-maven-plugin/test-mojo.html>. Maven had been ignoring the unrecognized names.
    - Logging: Turn up the logLevel to make any future problems easier to diagnose.
    - Documentation: Explain the presence of some scary "Ignored 53 units with compilation errors" warnings.

    Add AbstractPackageSanityTests.UNDERSCORE_IN_NAME to make it easy to exclude generated classes like AutoValue_Foo from testing. The issue is that these classes typically do not apply @Nullable to the argument of equals(Object), so that they will work when Nullable is not on the classpath. But NullPointerTester requires @Nullable on this argument because otherwise it will fail when equals(null) follows its contract and does not throw an exception.

    Major refactoring of EventBus, in preparation for further changes.
    
    - Make an Executor a property of all EventBuses, not just AsyncEventBus. A normal EventBus uses a direct Executor by default. Executors are stored per-subscriber.
    - Pull out the event dispatch strategy into a Dispatcher class. This handles how events are queued (or not) as they're posted. EventBus and AsyncEventBus each use strategies that should match their old behavior exactly.
    - Pull out the subscriber registration code into a SubscriberRegistry class. At the same time, switch back to using a ConcurrentMap<Class<?>, CopyOnWriteArraySet<Subscriber>> to store subscribers in order to allow lightweight, copy-free immutable snapshots of all subscribers to an event.
    - Rename EventSubscriber to Subscriber and make some changes to it. Move most code related to actually invoking a subscriber method to it.
    - Expose the EventBus's identifier.

    Make the timing assertions more forgiving.
    
    Originally I just changed it to be within 50ms of 203ms and that was still too
    tight (flaked at least 0.001%) so I abandoned that and just asserted that we have a timing for service
    b.

    Add failure causes as supressed exceptions for each failed service in the exception thrown by
    awaitHealthy.
    
    Technically these supressed exceptions are already logged, but putting the
    exceptions in the exception that is actually thrown is slightly more useful
    since it will get picked up properly by some tools which expect to
    interrogate causes.

    The @GuardedBy annotations in this CL did not follow the JCIP semantics: either
    they referred to locks that did not exist, or they were being used for general
    documentation.
    
    The annotations are being replaced with comments in preparation for enabling
    static analysis of @GuardedBy annotations.

    Replace meaningful Javadoc with GWT-emulation boilerplate.
    
    I have two main reasons for this:
    1. Meaningful Javadoc is sure to get out of sync between the two versions.
    2. Boilerplate helps to distinguish the two in searches, e.g., http://jsearch.[]/search?jq=immutablecollection
    
    There's also the implicit third reason "We do it this way in the other classes." If we instead want to include real Javadoc, it would be nice to do so consistently.

    Fix Guava issue 1751
    
    http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1751
    
    The bug is that this test depends on listener ordering. I believe that this race was technically introduced by [], since our strategy for invoking listener callbacks was sufficiently serialized prior to that cl, such that this was safe even though it violated the spec.
    
    As it is, it takes some seriously bad luck to observe the race (thanks cpovirk!)

    - Standardize the method name format.
    - Standardize on returning the next available time (rather than the wait time that one of the two currently returns).
    - Standardize on allowing the return value to indicate a time in the past (rather than requiring it to be a present/future time as one of the two currently does).
    
    Also, improve tests and documentation around all this, particularly the "in the past" part.

    Test mocking of RateLimiter to avoid regressions like that of CL 65383672.
    Ideally we will make all non-final methods mockable, but for now, I'll settle for not breaking any new ones.
    (The real fix may be a bigger project, e.g., converting RateLimiter to an interface. I don't know yet.)

    Migrate calls to Annotation.getClass() to Annotation.annotationType().
    
    Annotation.getClass() returns a proxy class generated at runtime that is not particularly useful -- it returns false for isAnnotation(), for example -- where annotationType() actually returns the type associated with the annotation (e.g. MyAnnotation.class for @MyAnnotation).

    Make Ints.tryParse available under GWT.
    
    It already works, thanks to careful avoidance of overflow in checks against |cap| and MIN_VALUE.
    (Contrast the previous (Android) version, which may or may not have worked under GWT because GWT integers don't wrap when they overflow. (I think that our workaround for this was successful, but it's hard to be confident.))
    
    Also, enable the tests for *Longs*.tryParse under GWT.
    (I also added a few more tests to both versions just to be paranoid.)

    Handle overflow and negative timeouts:
    http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1622
    
    Some discussion of each:
    - Overflow is of course impossible to prevent entirely with fixed-size number types, but we're less likely to see overflow with the new "available - timeout" than with the old "now + timeout': The latter can overflow almost immediately if given MAX_VALUE timeout. (Compare the advice at <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime%28%29>.)
    - Negative timeouts are supported by java.util.concurrent APIs. For similar behavior in RateLimiter, we need to be sure that a request to "wait up to -1 seconds" is treated identically to "wait up to 0 seconds" -- specifically, that it works right if the permit has become available within the last second. (Another potential problem, albeit one much less likely, is overflow when subtracting an input of MIN_VALUE.)

    Reimplement legacy RateLimiter as a passthrough to its reimplementation under the new RateLimiter API.
    I've mostly attempted to leave the behavior untouched, but there are a few changes:
    - Fixed a bug that would arise with a negative nanoTime() (probably unlikely, but it could happen).
    - Removed logging.
    - Stop swallowing interrupts.
    
    (Retry of CL 65383672, which was rolled back in CL 65402625 because of breakages in mocks, fixed by lazily initializing the mutex field.)

    Fix test that will fail in an upcoming patch to GWT.
    
    The semantics for String.toUpperCase() are that of the JavaScript browser implementation and might not conform to their JRE specification.
    
    In FF "pa\u00dfword".toUpperCase() is not "PASSWORD"; however the test was succeeding in GWT due to a pass of static evaluation that was done in the GWT compiler. The GWT compiler is removing all optimizations from -draftCompile and in that scenario the test fails.

    - For a Collection<T> parameter that we don't know how to generate, fail the test. Previously, we would sometimes generate a Collection<String>, since the value is usually used only for equals() and hashCode() testing. (All this also applies to most other JDK and Guava collection types.) http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1665
    - For Optional parameters, generate Optional.absent() before generating any Optional.of(...) instances.

    Make common.reflect build and pass tests against both Java 7 and Java 8.
    
    In particular, Java 7 had both the TypeVariable and AnnotatedElement interfaces, which were unrelated.  In Java 8, TypeVariable extends AnnotatedElement, and gained a method getAnnotatedBounds(), returning an AnnotatedType[], where AnnotatedType was an interface introduced in Java 8.
    
    We now have TypeVariableImpl extend a class NotAnnotatedElement, which provides an implementation for AnnotatedElement where no annotations are present, and throw UnsupportedOperationException on TypeVariableImpl.getAnnotatedBounds().

    This happened once with SafeHtmlBuilder and I nearly did it again recently. We can export classes that make use of @CompileTimeConstant if we make sure we export only specific methods, but for now it's simpler to blank disallow any class with @CompileTimeConstant.

    Clean up misuses of Truth where proposition values are passed into ASSERT.that() instead of the object under test.  This leads to patterns like:
    
    ASSERT.that(myMap.values().isEmpty());
    
    The above will do exactly nothing, because Truth is a fluent API and expects a value and returns an object with custom proposition methods on it, i.e.
    
    ASSERT.that(myMap.values()).isEmpty(); is the appropriate fix.
    
    This is in preparation for an upgrade to Truth which includes @CheckReturnValue on methods like .that() in order to let error-prone flag these as a compile-error.

    Change the behavior of Service.Listener and ServiceManager.Listener such that we guarantee that listener callbacks (for a single listener) will never be called concurrently.  Previously, the only semantics we guaranteed was about the order in which callbacks were submitted to executor.execute.  This significantly strengthens those guarantees.
    
    This is being done to resolve the flake that cpovirk@ identified here:
    https://sponge.[]/target?id=58fc52ba-a5f8-4619-83d3-ea0a28b9ee72&target=//javatests/com/google/common/util/concurrent:MediumTests
    
    The flaky test could be fixed either by using a SerializingExecutor in the test
    or by changing the semantics of Service/SeriveManager.addListener to guarantee
    serial callback execution.  I've opted for the latter since this is a very rare
    and confusing race and it is unlikely that any user would actually want their
    callbacks to execute concurrently.
    
    To implement this I've deleted ExecutionQueue and introduced a new object
    called SerialListenerQueue that is essentially
    ExecutionQueue+SerializingExecutor.  I've implemented it this way rather than
    by combining ExecutionQueue with SerializingExecutor since:
    1. ExecutionQueue	relies on poorly documented features of ConcurrentLinkedQueue
    2. ExecutionQueue is itself quite complicated
    3. that would introduce an extra queue operation per callback execution

    Automatically add <inherits> for java.* emulations to Guava.
    Remove the manually added <inherits>.
    
    This change applies only to java.* emulations: Normally <inherits> are added automatically as part of the build.
    The problem here was that the java.* <inherits> added were for internal-only modules that only transitively pulled in the public modules.
    This change rewrites the internal-only module names to match the public module names.
    
    The result is mostly a no-op, but, in addition to some theoretically irrelevant reordering, the automation also produces a few <inherit> fixes:
    - Remove net -> util.
    - Remove collect/testing -> util.
    - Add collect/testing -> truth.
    - Add collect/testing/google -> truth.
    
    Additionally, the automation identifies that cache was missing a BUILD dependency on util.
    (It got away with it because the dependency was pulled in transitively through base. (This worked because strict Java deps doesn't fully apply to GWT.))
    I have added the appropriate dependency.
    
    (This CL redoes *most* of CL 62235637 (which was rolled back in CL 62240733), and it also touches other packages that that CL did not.)

    Add a more descriptive error message when AsyncFunction.apply returns null.
    
    As it currently is, the NPE gets thrown several lines later in a very confusing function which, at first glance, should not be able to produce an NPE (since outputFuture is not @Nullable).  And since outputFuture looks like (but isn't) a field, one has to search the entire class to determine how it was set to null in the first place.  This adds a very clear message to the NPE saying that AsyncFunction may not return null.

commit 5f913f5e6411698a4e50a0593ea4db4632e2c912
Author: Chris Povirk <cpovirk@google.com>
Date:   Mon Feb 3 12:42:58 2014 -0500

    Change TypeResolver to not construct new TypeResolver when all the bounds remain the same. This is to work round the change in JDK TypeVariableImpl.equals().
    
    In summary:
    
    1) When <A> resolves to itself <A> (i.e. all bounds resolve equal to themselves), uses the original TypeVariable instead of the Guava artificial TypeVariableImpl, which doesn't compare equal with JDK TypeVariableImpl.
    
    2) In order to do 1), we need TypeVariableImpl.equals() to compare bounds too.
    
    3) Uses TypeVariableKey as key in the map from TypeVariable to Type, during resolution. This ensures that during type resolution, despite the change of equals() in 2), the same type variable with or without partially resolved bounds is always mapped to the same resolved type.
    
    4) Since JDK's TypeVariableImpl no longer compares equal with our custom TypeVariableImpl. We need to change equals() to do the same to ensure symmetry.
    
    5) All of the above are done conditionally only under the new JDK.

commit eb89cdb025ca9e5498e51f0aa1303f0dbfa09d5c
Author: Chris Povirk <cpovirk@google.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 24 19:37:36 2014 -0500

    Stop using assertSeededHashFunctionEquals for goodFastHash.
    The problem is that goodFastHash(n) is sometimes equal to goodFastHash(m) even when n and m are different.
    Basically, the value is rounded up to a multiple of 128.
    (It's a size, not a seed as it is for the other Hashing methods.)
    
    Currently the test passes because of the specific values that the test Random generates.
    However, which specific numbers are used for goodFastHash is dependent on the order in which the Hashing methods are tested, which is dependent on the JVM.
    The methods are reordered with the latest JDK7 build, breaking the test (at least in Guava, which has a slightly different set of methods than internally).
    
    We could "fix" this by sorting the methods before testing them, but the fundamental problem is that assertSeededHashFunctionEquals makes sense for seeds but not sizes.
    (This basic fact is hinted at by a comment that already existed in the test.)

    Add some performance enhancements to Striped:
    
    1. Enhance bulkGet to not call getAt() for runs of identical stripes
    2. Introduce a new Striped implementation for LazyWeak Striped instances with
    small numbers of stripes
    
    To justify this I also added a caliper benchmark.
    
    It is a minor runtime improvement in all but cases where there are a small
    number of stripes where it is a major improvement
    
    The LAZY_SMALL appears to be superior in all cases until the stripes size gets very large where the large array size becomes a potential issue.  Due to this i have introduced a static integer LARGE_LAZY_CUTOFF at 1024 so that lazyWeak striped instances with more than that many stripes use the legacy implementation.

    Remove deprecated, unused, Google-internal Futures.transform overload that accepts a plain Future.
    The ListenableFuture overloads appear to be serving users well.
    For those users who are stuck with a plain Future, we still provide Futures.lazyTransform, which has similar but not identical behavior to Futures.transform. Specifically, lazyTransform does not cache the result of the transformation. This could in principle result in Futures whose value changes over time. This, along with the potential costs of repeated function application, is a reason to prefer Futures.transform when possible.

    Fix a number of test failures running the backport under JDK5.
    
    - Sets.testPowerSetIteration seemed to be relying on the order of elements in a HashSet.
    - ImmutableSortedSetTest.testDifferentComparator_serialization was relying on Collections.reverseOrder() deserializing to the singleton instance of it.
    - ImmutableSortedMultisetTest.testCopyOfDefensiveCopy and testCopyOfSortedDefensiveCopy were relying on the JDK calling toArray(), while JDK5 is calling toArray(T[]).

    Converter.from(forwardFunction, backwardFunction). This will be essential in
    JDK 8. It's probably not that useful before then, but... why not?
    
    (Converter.from is Google-internal currently, but we've accidentally released the implementation. We'll strip it out later.)
    
    Sneak in a few javadoc tweaks.

    Remove DI annotations from ServiceManager.
    
    If this breaks your server due to a missing @Inject constructor on ServiceManager, please install a com.google.common.util.concurrent.ServiceModule in your injector to provide an identical binding.
    
    Tap global presubmit has been run with this change multiple times to try to identify all servers that would break when this constructor is deleted, all those injectors/servers have been fixed.  However, if your injector does not have a tap test that would expose this issue, this cl may break your server.  The fix is simple, please let me know and i can send advice/followup cls.
    
    This is the final step of a Large Scale Change ([]across [].  See https://docs.google.com[]document/d/1HxavPxi9152BGIhWhfpwXhrj2Roagq4rgj5f-PiBGl0/edit?usp=sharing for more information.

    Stabilize the UncaughtExceptionHandlers against exceptions thrown in
    logging. Quoting from the Java manual: "Any exception thrown by this
    method [uncaughtException] will be ignored by the Java Virtual Machine."
    This seems slightly paranoid, but doesn't cost us much and avoids stupid
    non-terminations in OOM situations or other logging failures.

    Adding equalsIgnoreCase for ASCII only. This exists because there's generally no good reason to use String.equalsIgnoreCase() with non-ASCII data (you should be using proper unicode normalization).
    
    Ideally we would migrate anyone calling
    equalsIgnoreCase("<ascii only>", x)
    equalsIgnoreCase(x, "<ascii only>")
    to use this and provide an error prone check for things like:
    string.toLowerCase().equals("<lower case ascii>")
    string.toUpperCase().equals("<upper case ascii>")
    
    Also provide benchmark (4x-5x faster than String.equalsIgnoreCase()).

    Javac 8 clean-up.
    
    Javac 8 places additional restrictions on generic type inference, and will
    occasionally report an inference error in situations where javac 7 would have
    been more permissive. This change allows compilation with javac 8 to succeed.

    Some documentation improvements for Ascii.truncate.
    
    Also remove the overload that used "..." as a default truncation indicator because:
    - Some people might assume that it used no truncation indicator ("")
    - It's easier to understand when reading if the indicator is passed explicitly
    - No need to warn people about "..." not being what they want to use for some locales

    Add benchmarks for Utf8.length.
    
    The biggest surprise for me was seeing how much performance of
    this micro-benchmark is dominated by branch-prediction
    penalty - 0x100 is twice as slow as either 0x90 or 0x800.

    Instead of just tracking our state via 2 integers in ServiceManager.State track all current service states via a Multimap<State, Service>.
    
    This enables some features.
    
    1. servicesByState() returns a consistent snapshot
    2. TimeoutExceptions report on the services that caused the timeout
    3. IllegalStateExceptions from awaitHealthy report on the services that are not running
    
    Also, this slightly simplifies the relationships between our 3 objects (ServiceListener, ServiceManager.State and ServiceManager) since ServiceManager no longer holds a reference to the Listeners directly.
    
    This should also fix b/10734437 because it simplifies the way that the stopwatches are handled and we also use a weak reference between the Listeners and ServiceManagerState to ensure that if the service manager is only partially constructed the listeners will become no-ops.
    
    I am not super tied to using the weak reference to solve this problem but it seems weird to keep updating this state object when there are no references to it.

    Change PathByteSource in MoreFiles to not use Files.readAllBytes() for its read() method, as Files.readAllBytes() creates 2 unnecessary copies of the byte array the file is read into in the normal case where the file doesn't change size.
    
    In the process of doing that, a few other changes:
    - Change both PathByteSource and FileByteSource to delegate to a new package-private method ByteStreams.toByteArray(InputStream, int) which handles reading to a byte array when you have an expected size.
    - Also change both implementations to get the expected size for the file from the size() method on FileChannel/SeekableByteChannel instead of reading the size attribute before opening the stream.

    Actually fix tearDown handling that was made worse in CL 50062431.
    - The behavior before that CL was to ignore exceptions thrown by tearDown.
    - The behavior currently is to exceptions thrown by tearDown unless there was another exception thrown by the test itself, in which case we overwrite the test's exception with the tearDown's exception.
    - The new behavior is to respect the exception from tearDown unless an exception from the test itself exists to override it. This matches the JUnit behavior. Really.
    
    This time, I've added (internal-only) tests.
    I also improved some error logging in the tests while I was debugging.

    Fix a race condition in
    AbstractServiceTest#testListenerDoesntDeadlockOnStopAndWaitFromTerminated.
    
    The race condition is triggered due to a slight difference in the behavior of
    startAsync().awaitRunning() vs. startAndWait()
    
    startAndWait() would return RUNNING even if the service in question was
    already TERMINATED whereas awaitRunning() will throw if the state is
    TERMINATED when it is called.
    
    The service in question here very quickly transitions from
    STARTING->RUNNING->TERMINATED so depending on thread timing awaitRunning
    could observe the service as RUNNING or as TERMINATED, the fix is to have the
    service shutdown be triggered by a call to stop rather than happening
    automatically.

    (Non-GWT ImmutableMap/ImmutableBiMap already got this right.)
    Plus, make ImmutableMap.copyOf(enumMap) and ImmutableMultimap.put(Entry) resilient to entries whose keys or values become null midway through construction.

commit 87c758892b137a647fdb975c79443519ff25828e
Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 17 16:59:10 2013 -0400

    Fix a couple of issues with JDK7 javadoc style by using a slightly customized version of the default stylesheet in Guava. Specific issues this fixes:
    
    - Huge text with a slightly misaligned first line in <pre>{@code} blocks in Guava javadoc (for example, see http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git-history/v14.0.1/javadoc/com/google/common/io/Closer.html). Both <pre> and <code> were increasing the font size. This changes the <code> block to inherit the font-size of the <pre> block.
    - No blank line before <pre> blocks in class-level javadoc. A CSS class rule for a div surrounding the class level javadoc set <pre>'s margin-top to 0.

    - Move close of <pre>{@code} blocks (i.e. "}</pre>") that are on a separate line up to the last line of the block contents, eliminating an extra blank line between the pre block and what follows.
    - Change a number of <pre> blocks to <pre>{@code} blocks.
    - Remove @Override from methods inside several <pre>{@code} blocks. When they're preceded by a {, they cause javadoc to screw up by thinking they're an invalid javadoc tag, even though it doesn't interpret tags inside {@code} blocks....

    Get rid of usages of TestUtil from common.io test classes and open source most of FilesTest.
    
    This includes several changes:
    
    1. Replacing the use of TestUtil.getSrcDir() to get at resources in the testdata package as Files. This is handled by creating a File from the URL path directly if it's a file:// URL and copying the resources to a temp dir on demand if it's not.
    2. Replacing the use of TestUtil.getTmpDirFile() with a temp dir created in a manner similar to Files.createTempDir(). Also, IoTestCase's tearDown() should ensure that any temp dirs/files created during tests are deleted afterwards.
    3. Changing some file paths in FilesTest to be built dynamically from their parts so as to hopefully work correctly on Windows as well as Unix systems. For example, instead of "/foo/bar", file(root(), "foo", "bar").
    4. Fixing a few things with the testdata resources in the BUILD file.

    The fact that ClassPath does a lot of I/O in its creation makes the two added methods unnecessarily expensive.  They still make sense, but perhaps not on this class.
    
    Rollback: Update ClassPath to expose the URIs that comprise the classpath.  Also add an asClassPathString method that lets you quickly go from ClassLoader to a classpath suitable for Java's -classpath flag.

    Then I went back and reverted false positives: EnumSet.allOf, EnumFilter.allOf, Matchers.allOf, IterablesTest.testSkip_allOf*.
    Then I reverted any tests that failed (all of which looked like they ought indeed to stay as allOf/allFrom.)
    I gave all the remaining automated changes a sanity check, and they all passed.

    Add a mechanism to ForwardingWrapperTester for when the forwarded interface contains methods that are defined to 'return this'.  In this case straight delegation doesn't work since the wrapped methods should return the forwarding object and not the delegate object.
    
    The strategy is to detect this situation by inspecting the return value of the forwarded method and if it is assignable to the interface type then we allow the forwarding method to return either the return value of the delegate or the wrapper itself.

    Migrate Caliper benchmarks from the old, superclass-based API to the new, annotation-based API.
    
    More information: LSC: Caliper Benchmark API migration (https://docs.google.com[]document/d/15KUhmIsTVn0EA9u2S5es4Otn5k3Lo_ZHhkDsT9LYRKc)
    
    ATTENTION REVIEWERS: This is a (mostly) scripted, behavior-preserving change. It should have the following effect:
    - No longer extend c.g.caliper.legacy.Benchmark
    - setUp method overrides are now annotated with @BeforeExperiment
    - tearDown method overrides are now annotated with @AfterExperiment
    - time methods are now annotated with @Benchmark and the time prefix has been removed

    TypeVisitor might be able to become something that's releasable for users to check on individual sub-components of a Type. Or, if after learning use cases, all that's needed are hasTypeVariables() and hasWildcards(), we'll just add the higher level APIs.

    Run "normal" GWT tests in public Guava.
    We still don't run the suite-builder tests, so the run is incomplete, but at least it's fairly quick:
    Tests run: 6667, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 155.218 sec
    
    Among the steps of this process covered by this CL:
    - Export the generated GWTTestCase files into Guava.
    - Add dependencies in guava-gwt on the guava (and guava-testlib) test sources.
    - Treat the GWT portion of guava-testlib as though it is part of the guava-gwt tests (to sidestep the issue that we should really have a separate guava-testlib-gwt artifact analogous to the separate guava-gwt project). (Mainly this means putting its files under guava-gwt/tests.)

    Use the renamingDecorator to ensure that Services always run in appropriately named threads.
    
    AbstractIdleService and AbstractScheduledService encode the current state in the name so you should see something like
    
    MyService (STARTING|RUNNING|STOPPING)
    
    AbstractExecutionThread service just uses the serviceName() (so it would be "MyService")  I could additionally try to encode the state but it didn't seem worth it.

    Provide ExecutorService decorators that will rename the threads in which its tasks run for the duration of the task.
    
    Open issues:
    1. should any of these be public?  Currently I am only planning on using them for some of the Service base classes so package private is fine, but we may want to make them public.
    2. I needed/wanted to use WrappingExecutorService but it was marked GoogleInternal, so i removed @GoogleInternal.  Is this ok? or should i use a similar private class? moe-strip public from it?

    remove the queuedListeners lock from both ServiceManager and AbstractService.
    
    The original idea of splitting the queuedListeners queue into one queue per listenerInstance didn't pan out because it didn't actually solve the issue of not holding a lock while submitting the listener to the executor.  So this is a different strategy.
    
    I pulled all the listener execution logic into a new class called ListenerQueue which is analogous to ExecutionList (not sure about the name though...) which cleaned up both AbstractService and ServiceManager.
    
    The approach is two-fold
    1. do not remove a listener from the queue of listeners until it has definitely been submitted to its executor
    2. ensure that submitting a listener to its executor happens no more than one time (using a lock).
    
    N.B. we are still vulnerable to a weird or buggy executor implementation. If calling execute(runnable) runs for a long time without calling runnable.run then we can still deadlock.  I don't believe we can actually solve this problem without giving up on the ordering guarantees.

    Update version number, factor out common config, plus a few nits, specifically:
    * 15.0-SNAPSHOT is the new release target
    * Plugin-management for commonly configured plugins moved into the parent.
    * Dependency management into the parents (for version and scope)
    * Make findbugs/javax.inject from provided to default (compile) scope, but mark optional.
    * Move Resources and sources paths into parent leaving exceptions in children.
    * Add a few helper comments for maintenance.
    * Add exclusions from Truth and Caliper to force use of guava being built.
    
    There are a few ways this could be locked down more, plugin versions implicitly pulled, etc., but not really necessary - just the ones we explicitly use and configure are important. There are other checks we could do, including pulling in errorprone or checkstyle to help developers building locally submit conformant patches, but this is a further evolution that can wait.

    Make GwtPlatform available to server-side applications.
    It's not actually used there, but dev mode clients do use it, and it won't be available to them unless it's compiled by javac as part of our GWT targets.
    
    One complication: The obvious way of doing this requires the server-side code to depend on the GWT target containing @GwtScriptOnly.
    This might be OK (though we'd have to check with at least one project, whose tests flag the new dependency), but it turns out to be unnecessary:
    @GwtScriptOnly has an effect only on the supersource class (which makes sense, since it's the supersource version that's the one being used in JavaScript only -- the GwtPlatform files I'm editing here are more like @UseThisInsteadIfNotGwtScript).
    Thus, I can remove it from these versions of GwtPlatform.

    Add calls to flush() after writing to streams in ByteSink and CharSink.
    
    It turns out that, under JDK6, FilterOutputStream.close() calls flush() and ignores any IOException it throws. This seems like pretty bad behavior, but we can work around it by manually flushing first. Doesn't seem like this should add much overhead for streams that don't require flushing before close either.
    
    On the other hand, this only applies to:
    - subclasses of FilterOutputStream
    - for which flush() does something
    - which do not override close() themselves
    - not running under JDK7+

    Delete the Ordering.from(Comparator) and Ordering.natural() overrides of sortedCopy and immutableSortedCopy, since benchmarks suggest any speed increases are minimal at best.

    Make a few small changes to ServiceManager
    1. use the Monitor.enterWhen* instead of Monitor.waitFor* methods, as they are more efficient.
    2. rewrite servicesByState to sort a list of Map.Entries instead of constructing a Map and sorting a copy of the EntrySet
    3. Add an addListener convenience overload for when you want to use the sameThreadExecutor.

    Adds @CheckReturnValue to chainable methods of FluentIterable. Thanks to error-prone, this will cause [] to refuse to build any code that doesn't store the return value from these methods.
    
    It will prevent subtle bugs where code is treating FluentIterable as though it is mutable, when in fact it is immutable.

    Make ExecutionList smaller and faster by using a manual queue instead of a LinkedList.
    
    With these changes:
    * An empty/executed ExecutionList is now half the size (20 vs. 40 bytes), it is also smaller after execution as well.
    * The new ExecutionList takes 16 fewer bytes per listener added also there is only 1 object allocated instead of 2.  Also, if the list has already been executed there is no longer any allocation in add.
    * There were also performance gains between 0 and 20% across the 4 benchmarks I wrote.

    Open source some more benchmarks.
    The Monitor benchmarks were left as internal when the class was migrated from Labs.
    My guess is that that was nothing more than "Caliper benchmarks can't be open-sourced yet."
    I notice that earlier CLs didn't open-source them, either.
    My guess is that that's just because they were excluded from the BUILD rule entirely and not merely marked with @GoogleInternal.
    My guess is that the same is true of the EventBus benchmark.

    A rewrite of Monitor internals.
    - use a linked list of active guards instead of an ArrayList
    - never signal next waiter while this thread still counted in active guards
    - optimize away excess signals
    - other stuff rewritten to Martin's taste
    
    Like lukes, I got bitten by the Improve Monitor bug, in part
    also as a learning experience.
    
    This class really needs more tests.

commit 02e459aacc3b534a580cd656b2e5d167b8b45026
Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 14 17:04:55 2013 -0500

    Reconcile @GwtIncompatible (and @GoogleInternal) annotations with the build-system lists of GWT-compatible (and GWT-compatible emulated) files.
    The main effect of this is to make InternetDomainName available under GWT in Guava. (It somehow seems to have worked anyway inside Google.) http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1253
    It's also necessary to make UnsignedInteger.multiply() (which is already deprecated) unavailable under GWT, since it is a simple passthrough to the times() method, which is also unavailable under GWT.

    Trim lots of unused and redundant code.  In particular,
    
    * refactor hash table size computations into one place
    * use Maps.safeGet and friends where appropriate
    * eliminate code duplication between the two skeleton implementations of NavigableMap.descendingMap()

    - Remove MapMaker.softKeys.
    - Remove AsynchronousComputationException (slated for November 2012 deletion).
    - Change Unsigned* methods' expiration from a month to a version, since "one version" is what we try to do, anyway, and we had scheduled them for "January" rather than "15.0."

    MOE stripping fixes:
    - Put "MOE:{begin,end}_intracomment_strip" in HTML comments so that it does not appear in internal Javadoc.
    - Turn scrub_sensitive_comments off so that MOE gives errors instead of silently stripping comments that contained sensitive words.
    - Where necessary, manually strip out sensitive words, remove them, or replace them with non-sensitive words.

    Minor optimizations for BaseEncoding.
    
    Specifically, we compute the exact size of the decoded byte array in the absence of a separator by trimming away padding characters before estimating the decoded size.

    Rewrite TreeRangeSet.complement() to be implemented in the same way as TreeRangeSet itself -- as a NavigableMap<Cut<C>, Range<C>> mapping lower bounds to ranges.
    
    This is a prelude to implementing TreeRangeSet.subRangeSet, which -- itself implemented as a NavigableMap<Cut<C>, Range<C>> -- will be chainable with complement() operations.

    Hides the mutex that is used by RateLimiter, so clients can't interfere with it.
    Note that the only current (and accidental) exposure of the fact that the RateLimiter
    uses "this" for synchronization, is the setRate/getRate methods, which have "synchronized"
    in their signatures.

It also is a case where we should provide an InputStream equivalent so that users don't create single use InputSuppliers/ByteSources.

    Change (most) methods in common.io that either return or take Input/OutputSuppliers to delegate to Sources/Sinks by wrapping suppliers as sources/sinks and vise versa. This also deprecates ByteStreams.getChecksum() and Files.getChecksum().

    Optimize LongMath.sqrt.
    
    This optimization depends on the fact that Math.rint(Math.sqrt((double) longValue)) is at most 1 away from the true value of sqrt(longValue), so there is no need for Newton's method iterations, or indeed any loops at all.

    Changed Futures.addCallback() not to call onFailure() when onSuccess() throws.
    
    Note to test owners:
    
    This change revealed test bugs in your test. The old code swallowed EasyMock "interaction expected" exception and passed it to your onFailure() method, which is a usually a no-op.
    
    I didn't dig deeply enough into your code to understand if the offending interactions are supposed to happen. The fix is just blindly adding expect() call to make the tests pass.
    
    If you see a real bug, please let me know.
    
    Thanks!

    Add ByteSource, ByteSink, CharSource and CharSink abstract classes and factory methods for creating various implementations of them.
    
    These classes are intended to replace the InputSupplier and OutputSupplier interfaces, providing advantages such as: no generics, a more consistent interface that reduces the need for static methods, and better discoverability.
    
    This helps pave the way for JDK7 by making it extremely easy to provide the same features for the new file APIs (Path) that we currently provide for Files, etc. All it will require is adding new factory methods to create Sources and Sinks wrapping a Path.

    Second try at adding MoreExecutors.platformThreadFactory().
    Now if ThreadManager.currentRequestThreadFactory() throws, we fall back to Executors.defaultThreadFactory().
    In particular, this happens when AppEngine is running in this JVM, but there is no AppEngine context for the current thread (i.e. we're "outside" appengine).

    Remove the State parameter from AbstractIdleService.executor.  This parameter is redundant with the value of the state() method at the times the method is called.  So it can be removed without removing functionality and it brings this method (more) in line with AbstractExecutionThreadService.executor and AbstractScheduledService.

    Rewrite HashBiMap to share entries between the forward and backward maps, yielding ~38% savings on memory.
    
    This imposes a small performance hit in the case of duplicate keys or values -- at most one addition traversal of a hash table bucket -- but no more.

    Add Java Checksums (CRC32, Adler32) to Hashing.
    
    This is done so that we can allow users to easily compute the checksum of some bytes (a file, say) without having to use the Checksum API directly.
    
    Also add an abstract Hasher shared by MessageDigestHashFunction and ChecksumHashFunction, since they operate basically the same way.

    Here's the string does include a ":" but does not have the port number, before this CL, HostAndPort.java tries to parse the empty string after ":" to a number and throws a NumberFormatException.

    Added testEquals() to AbstractPackageSanityTests.
    
    Extracted some of the code into a new ClassSanityTester class.
    
    Also added utility to test factory classes such as Predicates, for example:
    
    new ClassSanityTester().forAllPublicStaticMethods(Predicates.class)
    .testEqualsAndSerialiable();
    
    This cannot be performed by package sanity tests because there is no reliable pattern to tell that a class is a factory class (using plural is tricky in i18n if not anything else). But I think adding a simple test to PredicatesTest for Predicates is already a lot easier.
    
    Added javadoc to explain which case are covered by these automated sanity tests and which aren't.
    
    Added ItemReporter to RelationshipTester and EqualsTester so that the error message can be customized. The default "group i, item j" message is useless for automated test, since user didn't explicitly create the equality groups and the group numbers and item numbers are meaningless to users.

    Allow synchronous calls to EventBus.post().
    
    As we're only reading the set of registered event handlers when an event is posted, it is more efficient to split the lock on handlersByType into read and write locks and only acquire the write lock in register() and unregister().

    Fix thread-safety of EventBus.
    
    In a previous change, handlersByType was converted from a ConcurrentMap to a SetMultimap. However, the SetMultimap returned by Multimaps.newSetMultimap is not threadsafe when concurrent operations update the multimap, even if the map and set factory are. This can cause registered subscribers to stop receiving events because they are dropped from the multimap.

    Added AbstractPackageSanityTests to apply automated sanity tests for an entire package.
    
    Yaks I needed to shave:
    - move a piece of reusable code from NullPointerTester into a new DummyProxy class.
    - Added a few new default values to ArbitraryInstances. (I'm thinking to change the default value of numbers to 1, in a separate CL)
    
    Added PackageSanityTests to common.reflect and common.testing, as dogfooding. Had to add some @Nullable and missing checkNotNull() as a result.
    
    Since APST is classpath sensitive, there are a lot of top-level class fixture files in the packagesanity package and each test case corresponds to a single java_test rule. That makes the CL more daunting than it actually is.

    Reconcile the cancellation semantics for Futures.combine, successfulAsList, allAsList, and withFallback to be consistent with Futures.transform.  Now, all cancellations are back-propagated to the input futures.  We also expose the interruption state in AbstractFuture with a protected method.  To ensure the interruption state is correct and threadsafe, we add an additional state to AbstractFuture's inner Sync class to atomically distinguish between cancelled and interrupted.

commit ae758e0347c5ca9cee84c5738411852c4960bd2f
Author: Chris Povirk <cpovirk@google.com>
Date:   Fri Aug 31 16:03:30 2012 -0400

    Add tests for ConcurrentSkipList{Map,Set} and for a TreeMap with no comparator.
    The latter requires suppressions for the same reason that our no-comparator TreeSet tests do: The first element is wrongly permitted to be inserted even if it's null.
    Also, fix up a few misnamed methods and a copy-pasted doc comment.

Author: Chris Povirk <cpovirk@google.com>

    Added  TypeToken#method() and constructor() to return Invokable<> with types resolved;
    
    Also changed Invokable.from(Method) to return Invokable<?, Object> since now clients can start from TypeToken.from() to get a really invoke()-able Invokable.

commit 7603bab156d498339a2468d24c2917e7ee58f72e
Author: Chris Povirk <cpovirk@google.com>
Date:   Thu Aug 30 12:42:50 2012 -0400

    Add ClassPath#getClassesRecursive().
    
    Removed ClassPath#getClasses(Package) for this subtlety in java.lang.Package's javadoc:
    """Within each ClassLoader instance all classes from the same java package have the same Package object"""
    
    I'm afraid that someone aware of the Package API may get confused by the getClasses(Package) and think that it will only return the classes the share the "same" Package object, while in fact it's only searching by name, not Package object identity. In other words, this method has the potential to be ambiguous semantically.

    Added null check from NullPointerTester-generated proxies.
    
    It should be reasonable for the follow method to check null through a collaborator:
    
    public void foo(String a, RejectNull b) {
    b.rejectNull(a);
    }
    
    interface RejectNull {
    void rejectNull(String s);
    }
    
    Because RejectNull *should* throw NPE by contract.
    
    If NPT generates this proxy, it should make sure the proxy checks nulls mandated by the method signature.

    Rewrite Futures.immediate*Future with simple immutable Future implementations, and change Futures.immediateFailingFuture to not rethrow on Error.  This speeds up the creation of immediate futures by a factor of 10, which is significant for, e.g. the upcoming asynchronous cache, which uses many more immediate futures, particularly for the translation layer between CacheLoader and AsyncCacheLoader.

    Fixed a race deadlock bug in AbstractServiceTest: when notifyStopped() is called after getStateHistory(), the latter takes the synchronization lock and also waiting on the latch; the former cannot count down the latch because it can't grab the synchronization lock. Also added missing tests for throwing exception from doStart(), doStop().

    Move c.g.c.collect.testing.GwtPlatform to guava-gwt.
    Eventually it may end up in a new guava-testlib-gwt.
    For the moment, though, let's just get it out of guava-testlib so that we don't need a GWT dependency there.
    This CL also removes that dependency.
    
    I've edited the MOE config to emphasize putting GWT stuff in guava-gwt over all other priorities.
    This moves some .gwt.xml files, which likewise would live in a guava-testlib-gwt area.
    It makes a special case for Testing.gwt.xml irrelevant, so I've removed it, though we'll want an analogous special case in a guava-testlib-gwt future.
    
    This CL also adds missing JUnit inherits.

    This version is updated to include support for values(), keySet(), and entries(), as well as iterators generated by these. These methods are used occasionally and the removal had led to errors in the first submission.
    
    This version has been tested on failing tests reported last submission and found to have no impact on these tests.

    Deprecate mutator methods on immutable/unmodifiable classes in common.collect.  It can't possibly be correct to invoke a method that mutates a collection on an immutable object and this will help catch those errors at compile time.  It also has the benefit that IDEs set up to filter deprecated methods from the auto-complete suggestions will filter out the unsupported methods.

    Make java_and_gwt_library support extra_module_contents, even though java_library doesn't :)
    This lets us remove our manually maintained (and often wrong) .gwt.xml files.
    Occasionally we still need an extra_module_contents file, and we should someday figure out why.
    (Note: Because java_and_gwt_library has access to information that plain java_library does not, it can actually be a bit smarter about what it puts in the .gwt.xml automatically.)
    The net effect on the GWT modules themselves is mostl

commit 8d5659ad0e137d3a594014793264292a75b48bb9
Author: Colin Decker <cgdecker@google.com>
Date:   Mon Jul 2 12:35:48 2012 -0400

    Fix 2 bugs in the AbstractService implementation of listeners.
    1. Ensure that the futures are updated before listeners are called consistently
    2. Fix a bug that would cause the running() callback to be invoked when the Service was transitioning from STARTING -> STOPPING directly.

    Add a state transition listening mechanism to Service and implement in AbstractService.
    
    This is the first of several CLs that will change the Service interface. The basic plan is:
    1. add the listener interface (this cl)
    2. add some utility methods for doing timed waits via the listener apis.
    3. migrate users of start() and stop() to void versions of those methods.

    Marks the methods in Longs regarding byte array conversions as GWT compatible,

    The only method not yet being GWT compatible was toByteArray, due to a bug in
    how GWT handles narrowing conversions on byte casts. To fix this, copied
    the implementation from util.UnsignedLongs.toByteArray, which is already used

Author: Kevin Bourrillion <kevinb@google.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 1 14:37:02 2012 -0700

    Stop depending on an ImmutableSortedSet quirk in getTypes():
    ImmutableSortedSet.copyOf() currently assumes, for a Set input, that there is no need to deduplicate inputs.
    This is true if the given Comparator if consistent with equals (really, consistent with the original Set's definition of equality).
    However, if it's not, we can get a set with "duplicates" according to the Comparator.
    getTypes() depends on this behavior because it sorts by type-hierarchy depth, which is no reason to treat objects as "equal."
    An upcoming CL will change ImmutableSortedSet.copyOf() to remove this behavior.

    Added TypeToInstanceMap, ImmutableTypeToInstanceMap and MutableTypeToInstanceMap, mirroring ClassToInstanceMap. One major difference, is that put() and putAll() aren't supported. This is because there is no way to check isInstance() for generic types at runtime. In addition:
    1. I added ImmutableTypeToInstanceMap.of() for empty map. I've wanted similar thing for ClassToInstanceMap in the past.
    2. Omitted MutableTypeToInstanceMap.create(). With diamond operator coming along soon, do we still benefit from hiding default constructor and exposing static factory? For one thing, default constructor works better with reflection-based frameworks, such as ArbitraryInstances.

commit 4f95e6ed7442be451a49207e103aa6a917d9737f
Author: Chris Povirk <cpovirk@google.com>
Date:   Tue May 29 18:42:17 2012 -0400

    Remove a redundant RegularImmutableSortedSet workaround for comparators that are inconsistent with equals().
    The workaround, added in CL 13880333, existed to support ImmutableSortedAsList.
    However, it turned out that the workaround was needed for other types, too, and it was added to ImmutableSortedAsList itself (but not removed from RegularImmutableSortedSet) in CL 29041788.
    This CL removes the redundant RegularImmutableSortedSet copy, moving its comments into the ImmutableSortedAsList copy.
    Additionally, it adds a test to demonstrate that the redundant copy, which is no longer used only by asList(), was causing problems.
    Our existing tests caught a similar problem when I applied Louis's pending http://codereview.appspot.com/6218056/

    Move the derived generators into separate classes that *are* GWT-compatible.
    Also acknowledge that a bunch of suite() aren't GWT-compatible; GWT has been ignoring them.

    Implement basic capacity control for immutable collection builders.  We don't expose them yet, though, until the API is agreed upon.
    This will likely pay off with the in-progress immutable collection rewrites, which make much more use of each other's builders internally.

    Deprecated NPT.ignore(Member); added ignore(Method) overload as the new preferred method. No one ignores constructor in []. And the code to ignore constructor would read less meaningful.

    Make MapTestSuiteBuilder (also BiMapTestSuiteBuilder) work under GWT, and then use it there (as well as the non-GWT ImmutableSortedMapTest, where it should have been used already).
    
    This primarily involves making more derived suites (e.g., keySet(), values(), entrySet()) work under GWT.
    The GWT test suites are produced with code generation, so, in order to work under GWT, a derived suite must be recognized by GwtTestSuiteGenerator so that we know how to generate code for it.
    I've generalized the existing DerivedTestIteratorGenerator support to support any DerivedGenerator (each of which should have a one-arg constructor accepting its inner generator as an argument).
    
    Now that we run MapTestSuiteBuilder tests, we can remove the individual, manually generated "derived" test suites.
    
    The MapTestSuiteBuilder tests did encounter a couple problems:
    - I had to move NullsBeforeB from MultisetCollectionTest to Helpers so that it could be used more widely (for reasons that its Javadoc hopefully makes clear).  (This was a problem in the test, not the production code.)
    - I had to support null queries in the GWT ImmutableSortedMap.  (While I was there, I also prevented us from double-wrapping any submaps with unmodifiableSortedSet, since we know that the original map was already unmodifiable.  This is a tiny optimization.)  The null-query behavior was a "bug," albeit a very small one.

    Make KNOWN_ORDER significant for Map tests.
    (There are no direct Map tests using KNOWN_ORDER, but we now pass KNOWN_ORDER on to our keySet, entrySet, and values sub-suites.)
    Start using KNOWN_ORDER in various tests, including automatically in all SortedMap and SortedSet tests.
    Introduce TestStringSortedMapGenerator to save us from having to write "sort(insertionOrder, Helpers.<String, String>entryComparator(Ordering.natural().nullsFirst()));" as an order() implementation over and over.

    Changed NullPointerTester to test inherited methods.
    
    We only cover inherited methods from superclasses of the same package. This is
    because we don't want to step into classes the author doesn't own.
    
    For example, one may inherit from AbstractList, even though
    AbstractList#equals() doesn't use @Nullable.
    
    While for classes of the same package, we consider moving a method from subclass
    to superclass a refactoring with no behavioral change. We don't want to silently
    lose coverage just because of a "extract to superclass" refactoring.
    
    Also, remove @GoogleInternal from getPackageName.

    Stop erroneously placing the "normal Java" version of TestPlatform under guava-gwt.
    (The GWT version happens to be missing, and we'll need to fix that up before the tests can run externally.)
    This fixes the Guava build breakage introduced by my Collections2 CL.

    Fix GWT behavior of "opportunistic" ImmutableList subclasses.
    The "standard" ImmutableLists were fine, but Lists.charactersOf() and
    TransformedImmutableList were broken.
    Under Java, they inherited working implementations of their methods; under GWT,
    they inherited versions that forwarded to an empty "delegate" collection.
    I've overridden all forwarding methods in the GWT emulation in order to avoid
    this.
    I've also added tests for charactersOf(), which reveal that GWT
    String/StringBuilder doesn't perform index checks, so I've added manual checks.
    TransformedImmutableList could probably stand to have some tests, too, but at
    least it will be exercised indirectly through the asList() views implemented
    atop it in Louis's coming CL, which is in fact what revealed these problems.

    To do so, make the minimal (I think) subset of common.math required work under GWT.
    This requires suppressing a few cases in the divide() tests due to GWT's non-compliant int implementation (which, for example, occasionally believes that 2147483648 is a valid int).

    Make ImmutableSortedSet implement NavigableSet.
    (Under GWT, it still implements only SortedSet.)
    From Louis: http://codereview.appspot.com/5590046/
    
    Also:
    Add suite-builder tests for ContiguousSet headSet/tailSet/subSet, and make the existing tests run the NavigableSet suite instead of just the Set suite (plus, do the same for some other ImmutableSortedSet tests).
    These reveal that ContiguousSet has the legal but somewhat antisocial behavior of throwing IllegalArgumentException for inputs outside its "restricted range" and the probably illegal but unlikely to matter behavior of throwing IAE for subSet(x, false, x, false); change both.
    Add GWT suite-builder tests for ContiguousSet, and make the existing GWT ImmutableSortedSet tests run the SortedSet suite (plus, add some missing ALLOWS_NULL_QUERIES features to the existing ImmutableSet tests).
    To allow those tests to cover the SortedSet methods, separate SortedSetTestSuiteBuilder out from NavigableSetTestSuiteBuilder, include splitting SetNavigationTester (and renaming MapNavigationTester, too, to keep the non-GWT glob simple).
    Along the way, promote TestIntegerSetGenerator and its SampleElements out of ContiguousSetNonGwtTest. (I think that this may have been necessary for GWT compatibility, but I forget.)
    Finally, some small cleanup:
    - Make less use of the scary ImmutableSortedSet(Comparator) constructor, and add warnings to its documentation. (A similar constructor has produced GWT bugs in ImmutableList subclasses, which I plan to look at next.)
    - Make /* @Override */ methods use @Override (if possible), or strip them with @GwtIncompatible (if not needed under GWT).

    Added default-value auto generation to NullPointerTester, for interfaces (and
    got rid of the manual registration of Function, Predicate and BinaryPredicate).
    
    To support generics correctly, I added common/reflect as dependency (which might
    be
    the biggest issue).
    
    Along the way, I needed the dynamic proxy to handler equals/hashCode/toString.
    
    Searched around for similar pattern and found about 30 clients that are rolling
    their own version:
    []
    So I added AbstractInvocationHandler that deals with this. Since NPT needs it, I
    went ahead and just made it @Beta and apache and everything. If we don't think
    it's worth releasing, I can move it to the common/testing package and make it
    package-private.

    Roll back CL 23327883's very broken FeatureSpecificTestSuiteBuilder optimization.
    (We don't clone the tests, so we run all methods against the same target class (the last to be initialized).)
    Fix up newly failing tests (except for CompactIntegerListTest, for which I've filed a bug).
    Most are problems with the tests themselves:
    - Test suppressions weren't being carried over to tests of the reserialized collections.
    - Map values() collections were universally assumed to permit null queries.
    - EnumSet was asserted to fail fast on concurrent modification.
    - Many ConcurrentModificationException tests advanced the iterator past the end of size-zero or size-one collections.
    - It's not possible to create an empty collection that contains null. Empty collections don't contain anything :)
    - (Bi)MapGenerator.create is passed an Object[] containing Entry objects, not an Entry[].
    - (Bi)MapGenerator.create is passed an Object[] containing Entry objects, not an Entry[].
    - StandardImplForwardingNavigableMap.keySet() returned a SortedSet instead of a NavigableSet.
    - StandardImplForwardingNavigableMap implemented lastEntry and descendingSet in terms of one another (using the standard* methods).
    - Tests of null SortedMultiset values fail when run against a nullsFirst() comparator because the nulls are outside the submultiset ranges tested.
    - NavigableSets.synchronizedNavigableSet(SafeTreeSet) does not allow null queries.
    - Tables.transformValues().cellSet() permits remove operations.
    - collect/testing SmallTests needed their timeout increased.
    - CompactIntegerListTest didn't specify all the mutation operations it supports.
    A few are fixed by improvements to production code that arguably aren't strictly "bug fixes":
    - ConcurrentHashMultiset.removeAll(collectionContainingNull) threw NPE.
    - Maps.unmodifiableNavigableMap().subSet/headSet/tailSet returned a SortedSet instead of a NavigableSet.
    - NavigableMaps.unmodifiableNavigableMap().keySet() returned a SortedSet instead of a NavigableSet.
    - RegularContiguousSet.contains/containsAll threw NPE (which the EmptyContiguousSet equivalents did not).
    - WellBehavedMap.entrySet().remove(null) threw NPE instead of returning false. (The fix removes the need for Sets.transform.)
    A few more are real bugs:
    - TreeMultiset.add(null) succeeded even for comparators that do not permit null.
    - TreeMultiset.remove(null) failed even for comparators that permit null.
    - TreeMultiset iterators couldn't remove null elements.

commit 17f6cb8aa782944d63d33232153cab4a417004d9
Author: Charles Fry <fry@google.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 23 16:29:53 2012 -0500

    Extracted part of NullPointerTester and Stub into NullValues;
    Added code to call default constructor if all else failed;
    
    Some potential incompatibility from previous version:
    1. Use ImmutableList.of() in place of Collections.emptyList(), ImmutableSet.of() in place of Collections.emptySet(). I don't anticipate issues here.
    2. Use ImmutableSortedSet.of() in place of new TreeSet(). mutable -> immutable.
    3. Use a Comparator that always returns 0, instead of reverseOrder() which requires T extends Comparable.
    
    If this sounds reasonable, I'll send it through global TAP queue to make sure it doesn't break builds.

    Switching to non-power-of-2 bloom filter sizes, and making serialization more
    future-proof.
    Unfortunately, this changes the serialized form, since hashBitsPerFunction was
    hardwired
    to the BloomFilter, and that really assumed power-of-two tables.
    Also, this fixes a nasty exponential-slowdown bug that was in the previous version of BloomFilter (that code was added to support serialization, and deleted as part of the new strategy for serialization)

    Strip workarounds for past Google bugs from public release.
    In fact, stripping the allAsList/successfulAsList code is basically a bug fix, as the existing workaround allows get() to block indefinitely after the Future is done.

    Fix two aspects of the AbstractScheduledService.CustomScheduler implementation
    1. Give the abstract callback method a more intuitive and convenient signature which will make it easier to ensure that weird things don't happen.
    2. Handle exceptions thrown from the scheduling callback.  Previously if this method threw an exception the service would silently stop running.  Typically without any logging or notification of any kind.

    Eliminate the reevaluateGuards method of Monitor and tighten the contract of Monitor.Guard.
    
    As Dimitris Andreou argued, "reevaluateGuards() ... doesn't seem to offer any advantage ... over ... use of Condition. Basically you give up implicit signaling, the main selling point of this class, and revert to manual signaling. Why not leave that scenario to Condition, and make this class simpler to use for its own sweet spot?"

    Remove @GuardedBy annotation from all public methods of Monitor.
    
    Rationale: It's arguably incorrect for leave, which gives up the lock. It doesn't make sense for the other methods either because "lock" is meaningless to users of the class. Furthermore, every one of these methods checks whether the lock is held if necessary, so there's not actually any danger in calling them incorrectly (they fail fast).

    Add explicit <K, V> to entryOf() call. The current code works in javac but fails compilation in Eclipse compiler. It could be Eclipse's fault. But it seems easy enough to avoid the gray area, no?

Author: Kurt Kluever <kak@google.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 22 12:13:03 2011 -0500

    Create PriorityQueue with internal capacity 2 instead of estimating the size from the number of inputs.
    This is simpler, and it might be faster than iterating twice.
    It might be slower if the input (a) is a Collection (so that size() is available) and (b) is larger than size 2 (so that growing the array is necessary), but I'm not too concerned.
    Only 2 of ~8 callers have a chance of passing in more than 2 inputs, anyway.

    - ListeningExecutorService can throw RejectedExecutionException.
    - Subclasses of AbstractListeningExecutorService must implement execute() and the shutdown/termination methods.
    Also, fix a comment in AbstractListeningExecutorServiceTest.

    Add AtomicDouble and friends.
    
    All derived from code originally written by Doug and friends
    for AtomicLong and friends.
    
    This version has marginally less efficient, but more portable
    implementation (doesn't directly use sun.misc.Unsafe).
    
    Updates JSR166TestCase to get latest Doug/Martin infrastructure.
    
    Currently, AtomicDouble seems unlikely to get into upstream
    java.util.concurrent.atomic, (so guava is likely to be its
    permanent public home) but I'd like to continue to keep the
    door open forever.

    The newly added tests discovered that Cache.gwt.xml contains dependencies that the package doesn't declare, and I've removed them.

    Add extensive tests for simplifyPath that aren't prefixed with /b/c.
    These tests caught the "." -> "" problem (though I initially ignored it... oops) and would have caught the if->while problem raised during review.
    I suspect they would also have caught the existing bugs, but I haven't yet confirmed this.

    I give up. I can no longer maintain the in-place algorithm. The bugs have defeated me.
    
    This cl introduces a much simpler, clearer algorithm that splits the path into pieces, and then builds a new path one piece at a time while resolving . and .. along the way.  Finally it does a little fixup to handle the initial slash, if any.

    SerializableTester.reserializeAndAssert checks that original.getClass() == copy.getClass().
    Fix EmptyContiguousSet serialization using cgdecker's patch (which also removes a redundant "implements Serializable" from RegularContiguousSet).
    Also, stop using reserializeAndAssert for the few instances in which the reserialized version of an object is a different class.

    The patch also:
    - adds equals/hashCode for Enums.valueOfFunction
    - makes the DiscreteDomain constructor visible, internally and externally (possibly controversial? but the whole class is still @Beta, anyway)

    In CheckedFuture Javadoc, emphasize that it has checkedGet(), not that it has addListener(), since any ListenableFuture has the latter.
    In Futures.transform/chain Javadoc, attempt to simplify the text about cancellation, and revise and move a not always accurate statement about sameThreadExecutor().

    Add a first pass to InetAddresses.forString() that validates the
    characters, and decides which address family's parser to call.
    
    Rewrite textToNumericFormatV6 so that it allocates fewer temporary
    strings, and correctly rejects IPv6 addresses like "0:1:2:3::4:5:6:7".
    
    Also remove some validation from parseOctet/parseHextet, because
    that's now handled by the first pass.

    - Make AbstractService's Futures implement ListenableFuture by reimplementing the custom Transition class on top of AbstractListenableFuture.
    - Remove asciiHtmlEscaper, replaced with Html.htmlContentEscaper.
    - Make Service.start() and stop() return a ListenableFuture.
    - Eliminate the distinction between Range and DiscreteRange and move operations that used to live in DiscreteRange into ContiguousSet.
    - Preserve strict/lenient validation when deriving IDN instances from other IDN instances. No test changes yet; wanted to get feedback on the approach first.
    - Add a deprecated version of Ranges.integers() and Ranges.longs() to temporarily fix builds.
    - MapMaker:
    	- containsValue should fail on collected key
    	- refine expiration javadocs
    	- structure all reads similarly, documenting more assumptions
    	- more white-box tests
    - Use constants in UriEscapers instead of PercentEscaper, deprecating the latter.
    - Make Javadoc (and occasionally FindBugs) happier.
    - Rename package.html files to package-info.html, which are preferred as for JDK 5 (see `man javadoc`).
    - Avoid stack overflow.
    - Make InternetDomainName lenient validation a little less lenient.
    - Remove all usages of Ranges.longs() and Ranges.integers().

    Assorted util.concurrent tweaks, mostly Javadoc.
    - @link from CheckedFuture to common implementations, since it seems that many people can't find them: https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/group/java-libraries-discuss/browse_thread/thread/83589a60aa3c5318
    - Warn that makeListenable(...).addListener() and friends use a thread.
    - Add examples to Futures.combine.
    - Rewrite the Javadoc for some methods in Futures to cram more information into the first sentence.
    - Also, stop extending Assert in ListenableFutureTester in favor of static imports.
    - Finally, make combine(..., Iterable) more permissive. (This should be backward compatible.)

    Push of latest guava code which unfortunately includes temporarily backing out
    the common.testing stuff, which still hasn't been figured out properly in a way
    that allows us to keep internal and external codebases synchronized.  That
    stuff may or may not be available as part of release 8 after all.

    Add the most basic portion of our testing infrastructure required to make the Guava tests pass, and add a replacement for Assert.* so we can have the assertions available to the tests in this core library, without forcing a dependency on JUnit or any other testing framework.  The tests, themselves, of course, can remain dependent on JUnit.

    @Beta release of MapMaker.maximumSize()!
    
    Add Interners.asFunction per issue 398.
    
    Start emulating ImmutableAsList, and make it GWT serializable.
    
    Add missing Javadoc to Maps.EntryTransformer.transformEntry().
    
    Since ConcurrentHashMap consistently invokes equals() as
    "objectYouJustGaveMe.equals(objectAlreadyInMap)", it was suggested we should do
    the same with our equivalences.
    
    Various small doc fixes.

    Rework RegularImmutableSortedSet to be backed by an ImmutableList instead of an array.
    
    Make IDN conform more closely to the Mozilla PS algorithm. In the process, we introduce a weird disjunction in our definition, but that seems unavoidable (for now?).
    
    Make com.google.common.base.Equivalence{,s} GwtCompatible.
    
    Make Futures.compose(Future, Function) wrap any RuntimeException/Error that occurs in an ExecutionException.
    Also, call the Function only once even if it throws.
    (Futures.compose(ListenableFuture, Function) already had both these behaviors.)
    
    Do not cancel() when interrupted. Do restore the interrupt.

    Next batch of pent-up fixes.
    
    Visible changes:
    - Add ImmutableSortedSet.copyOf(Collection) which is safe for concurrent
      modification.
    - Make ImmutableSet.copyOf(Collection) public.
    - Various Futures javadoc improvements (also use <V> and <X> over <T> and <E>).
    - Revamp javadoc for Function, Predicate and related classes. Highlight the
      issue about consistency with equals, as this problem has been noticed with
      utilities like Sets.filter() (issue 363).
    
    Less-visible changes:
    - Add a few missing @Nullable annoations.
    - In Iterables.concat impl, create an Iterator<Iterator> directly rather than via transform().

    3 days of pent-up improvements:
    - Make setException(null) throw NullPointerException instead of silently
      setting the future to succeeded (with a result value of null).
    - Remove unnecessary type parameter from transformExceptions() and its
      implementation class.
    - New ConcurrentHashMultiset factory method that takes a MapMaker. This allows
      using soft/weak keys and expiration on the backing map.
    - Turns out it's annoying to not know whether it's the key or value that was
      null in an ImmutableMap.
    - Tiny javadoc fixes, mostly concerning code snippets.
    - Introduce a package-private Iterables.toArray(Iterable) method as a
      GWT-compatible alternative to the public Iterables.toArray(Iterable, Class),
      and achieve a marginally more efficient implementation of the GWT emulation
      for ImmutableSet's Builder and copyOf methods.
    - Make EnumBiMap and EnumHashBiMap GwtCompatible.

    Add ImmutableSet.copyOf(Collection), following lead of ImmutableList, to make it safe with copyOf(synchronizedConcurrentList).
    
    Also had to add ImmutableSortedSet.copyOf(Collection), to make Java overloading happy.
    
    I guess another alternative, is to hide the copyOf(Collection) overload and make sure copyOf(Iterable) is safe when the iterable is actually a Collection. (But why is ImmutableList.copyOf(Collection) needed?)
    
    I also added ImmutableSortedSet.copyOf(Comparator, Collection), for sake(excuse) of consistency.

    Add maven metadata and a faux maven project hierarchy for multi-module support to build this as several smaller maven modules, as well as the monolithic jar.
    
    Also, add a README.maven to talk about this in general
    
    Lastly, add a note in README about needing a 1.5 JDK that includes the @Overrides patch, since we use @Overrides to override interface methods, not just concrete/abstract class methods.
