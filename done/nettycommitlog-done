    [#5062] Mark MqttEncoder @Sharable
    
    Motivation:
    
    Commit 2696778 changed MqttEncoder to be a singelton but missed to add @Sharable annotation. This broke the encoder as it can not be added to multiple pipelines.
    
    Modifications:
    
    Add @Sharable annotation
    
    Result:
    
    MqttEncoder can be used in multiple pipelines again.

    [#4755] Make WebSocketClientCompressionHandler @Sharable
    
    Motivation:
    
    WebSocketClientCompressionHandler is stateless so it should be @Sharable.
    
    Modifications:
    
    Add @Sharable annotation to WebSocketClientCompressionHandler, make constructor private and add static field to get the instance.
    
    Result:
    
    Less object creation.
